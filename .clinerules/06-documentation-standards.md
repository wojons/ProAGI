# Documentation Standards

This document outlines documentation standards for the ProAGI project, drawing from previous project guidelines.

- Ensure docstrings explain the 'why', not just the 'what'. (Ref: 10-documentation.md)
- Use `# TODO:`/`# FIXME:` markers appropriately. (Ref: 10-documentation.md)
- Keep `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated. (Ref: 10-documentation.md)
- Calls modifying definition state via `StateManager` require meaningful commit messages. (Ref: 04-state-management.md)
