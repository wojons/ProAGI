## Brief overview
This guideline specifies that all work for this project must be tracked in GitHub issues.

## Development workflow
- All work, without exception, must be tracked as a GitHub issue.
- **Issue Creation and Detail:**
    - Each task, feature, or bug must have a corresponding GitHub issue.
    - Issues should be detailed, including clear descriptions, acceptance criteria, and any relevant context.
    - Large tasks should be broken down into smaller, manageable sub-tasks within the issue comments or linked issues.
- **Commenting and Collaboration:**
    - Use issue comments for all discussions, clarifications, and progress updates related to that specific task.
    - When encountering problems or blockers, comment on the relevant issue to document the problem and seek assistance.
- **Task Assignment and Management:**
    - Developers should assign themselves to issues they are actively working on.
    - The status of development (e.g., "in progress", "awaiting review", "done") should be reflected in the issue's state or labels.
- **Direct Management:**
    - The GitHub issue tracker will serve as the primary source for managing all software development work for this project.
- **Git Repository Updates:**
    - Always update the Git repository when a task is complete to ensure no work is lost.
    - All related GitHub issues should be updated based on the completed work, with the issue number tracked in the commit messages for easy linking.

## Task Initiation Workflow
- When starting a new task in the plan phase, first check existing GitHub issues to see if any are related to the proposed work.
- If related issues exist, update and refine the existing ticket before proceeding with the work.
- If no existing issues align with the proposed work, create a new GitHub issue for the task and then proceed.
