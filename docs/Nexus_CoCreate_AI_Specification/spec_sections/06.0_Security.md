# 6.0 Security Considerations

## 6.1 Error Handling - Standardization

This section defines the standardization of error codes within the Nexus CoCreate AI platform, particularly for the sandbox API.

*   **User Interface (Chat):** For human readability in the chat interface, use prefix-based codes (e.g., `DOCKER_IMAGE_NOT_FOUND`, `PROMPT_VALIDATION_ERROR`). These are primarily for internal understanding or if a power user mode exposes them.
*   **Internal Logging:** For richer detail and easier lookups in internal logs, use a combination code (e.g., `NEXUS_DOCKER_001_IMG_NOT_FOUND`). This allows for more detailed internal tracking.

## 6.2 Error Handling - UX Display

This section clarifies how errors are displayed to the user across different UI components (Chat vs. Canvas), with a focus on self-correction.

*   **Self-Correction Priority:** The system (Nexus/LLM) MUST attempt to self-correct errors first. Most users will not understand technical errors and expect the AI to resolve them.
*   **Chat Display:**
    *   Inform the user minimally when an error occurs and self-correction is being attempted (e.g., "Encountered a small issue, working to resolve it...").
    *   Avoid showing raw technical error messages or codes to the average user.
    *   If self-correction is successful, Nexus proceeds, possibly with a brief confirmation.
    *   If self-correction fails, Nexus should communicate this in a user-friendly way (e.g., "I tried a few ways to fix that, but it didn't quite work. I'll try a different strategy to get your app built.") and explain its next general approach, rather than asking the user to debug.
*   **Canvas Display:**
    *   If an error relates to a file open in the Canvas, the Canvas might subtly indicate the area Nexus is working on during self-correction (for transparency if the user is observing). This is not for user debugging.
    *   Detailed error messages and codes (like `NEXUS_DOCKER_001_IMG_NOT_FOUND`) should be available in system logs or a "developer/advanced mode" viewable in the Canvas, primarily for system debugging or power users.

## 6.3 Error Handling & Self-Correction Flow (Conceptual)

This illustrates Nexus's approach to errors, prioritizing self-correction, based on refinement point #4.

## 6.4 API Key Management (BYOK) - POC Scope

This section clarifies the approach to API key management for the POC, focusing on user control and flexibility.

*   **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) – Core Principle for Flexibility and Cost Control:** Users should be able to provide their own API keys for various LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere) and potentially other external services. For the POC, focus should be on supporting BYOK for at least one or two major LLM providers.
*   **Management via Nexus – Conversational Control for Ease of Use:** Users will primarily manage these API keys and other essential application configurations conversationally through their Nexus assistant. This avoids the need for users to navigate complex settings pages.
*   **Storage (POC Security – Simplified but Mindful of User Experience):** For the MVP/POC, the primary focus is on achieving functional key management. Robust, enterprise-grade secret management solutions are post-POC goals.
    *   **Storage Options for POC:** API keys can be stored in simple, dedicated configuration files (e.g., a `secrets.yaml` or `.env` file) within the project's specific Git repository. These files should ideally be added to the project's `.gitignore` by default if they are intended to be truly local to the user's instance and not committed to a shared remote, or handled with Git-crypt or similar if they must be in the repo but encrypted. Alternatively, keys could be managed as environment variables that are securely injected into the application's specific sandbox (Docker container) at runtime by the SandboxManager.
    *   **Crucially, for User Experience and Basic Security Hygiene:** Nexus MUST mask the API key input in the chat interface when the user is providing it (e.g., displaying asterisks or dots instead of the actual characters). The key should also not be echoed back in plain text in subsequent messages.
*   **Dependency Resolution for Cloned/Shared Apps – Guided Configuration:** If a user installs or clones an app from a template or a shared source, and that app requires specific API keys to function, Nexus must play an active role in ensuring the app is usable. Nexus will parse the newly installed app's AppDefinition to identify any missing API key configurations and then conversationally guide the new owner through the process of providing their own keys. Nexus could also offer to use a globally configured key if the user has one set up and it's appropriate for the app, or guide them to where they can obtain such a key if they don't have one.

## 6.5 Permissions & Database Role - POC Scope

This section clarifies the role of the database in managing permissions for the POC.

*   **Database Strategy:** A full database system is planned. For the POC, this will likely be an embedded database (e.g., SQLite). Longer-term, this may transition to a service like Supabase.
*   **POC Permissions Management:**
    *   For a primarily single-user POC, complex permissions are not a focus.
    *   The embedded database (SQLite) will be used to store basic system-level or admin configurations, such as an admin's ability to "allow/block BYOK" for users on a self-hosted instance.
    *   Project-specific definitions, configurations, and code artifacts remain primarily in Git.
    *   If any user-specific settings (beyond API keys which have their own defined handling) or very simple role distinctions are needed for the POC, they would reside in this embedded database.
