### 4.9 FileInfo

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing information about a file or directory within the versioned Definition/Config state managed by the `StateManagerInterface`. This structure is used when listing the contents of a directory.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "path": "string", // The path of the file or directory relative to the state root
  "type": "string", // Indicates if the entry is a "file" or a "directory"
  "size": "integer", // Optional: The size of the file in bytes (for files)
  "lastModified": "string" // Optional: ISO 8601 timestamp of the last modification
  // ... other relevant file metadata ...
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `path`: The path of the file or directory relative to the root of the versioned state (e.g., "applications/core.framework/definition.yaml", "prompts/use_cases/").
*   `type`: A string indicating whether the entry is a "file" or a "directory".
*   `size`: An optional integer representing the size of the file in bytes. This field is typically only present for entries where `type` is "file".
*   `lastModified`: An optional ISO 8601 formatted string indicating the timestamp of the last modification.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `StateManagerInterface` in response to a `ListDefinitionDirectoryRequest`.
*   Used by components that need to browse or understand the structure of the versioned Definition/Config state (e.g., the `ApplicationRegistry`, AI logic for exploring configuration files).
