### 4.10 CommitInfo

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing information about a version or commit within the versioned Definition/Config state managed by the `StateManagerInterface`. This structure is used when retrieving the history of a file or directory.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "version": "string", // The unique identifier for the version/commit (e.g., Git commit hash)
  "author": "string", // The author of the commit
  "message": "string", // The commit message
  "timestamp": "string" // ISO 8601 timestamp of when the commit was created
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `version`: The unique identifier for the version or commit. In a Git-based storage system, this would typically be the commit hash.
*   `author`: A string indicating the author of the commit.
*   `message`: The commit message associated with this version. Provides context about the changes included in this version.
*   `timestamp`: An ISO 8601 formatted string indicating the exact time when the commit was created.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `StateManagerInterface` in response to a `GetDefinitionFileHistoryRequest`.
*   Used by components that need to view the history of changes to the versioned Definition/Config state (e.g., the `ApplicationRegistry` for tracking application definition versions, the UI for displaying history to the user).
