### 4.14 ServerStatus

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing the status of a connected MCP server managed by the `McpHub`. This structure is used when listing or retrieving the status of MCP servers.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "serverName": "string", // The unique name or identifier of the MCP server
  "status": "string", // The current connection status (e.g., "connected", "connecting", "disconnected", "error")
  "type": "string", // The type of connection (e.g., "stdio", "sse", "http")
  "endpoint": "string", // The connection endpoint (e.g., "localhost:8811", "ws://...")
  "error": { // Optional: Details about an error if status is "error"
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string"
  }
  // ... other relevant status details (e.g., last seen, uptime) ...
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `serverName`: The unique name or identifier used to refer to the MCP server.
*   `status`: A string indicating the current connection status of the server (e.g., "connected", "connecting", "disconnected", "error").
*   `type`: The type of connection protocol used to communicate with the server (e.g., "stdio" for standard I/O, "sse" for Server-Sent Events, "http" for standard HTTP APIs).
*   `endpoint`: The network address or identifier used to connect to the server (e.g., "localhost:8811", "ws://host.docker.internal:9222").
*   `error`: An optional JSON object providing details if the server is in an "error" status.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `McpHub` based on the status of its connections to external MCP servers.
*   Provided by the `McpHub` in response to `ListConnectedServersRequest` or `GetServerStatusRequest`.
*   Used by components that need to monitor or understand the state of connected MCP servers (e.g., the `ToolManager` for routing tool requests, the UI for displaying available servers).
