### 3.10 LoggingService

**Purpose:** The conceptual component responsible for collecting, processing, and storing structured logs generated by various components and applications within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. It provides a centralized logging mechanism for monitoring, debugging, and auditing.

**Transport Protocol:** gRPC (Internal, high-performance communication).

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Receiving structured log messages from components and applications (e.g., via the `Core Framework API`).
*   Adding standard context fields to log messages (e.g., timestamp, traceId, appId, taskId, requestId).
*   Processing and potentially filtering log messages based on severity level or other criteria.
*   Storing log messages persistently (conceptual - details like storage backend would be implementation details).
*   Providing an interface for querying or retrieving log messages (conceptual).
*   Potentially forwarding logs to external monitoring or analysis systems (conceptual).

**gRPC Service Definition (Conceptual):**

```protobuf
service LoggingService {
  rpc LogMessage (LogMessageRequest) returns (LogMessageResponse); // Matches CoreFrameworkAPI's LogMessage
  // Add methods for querying logs, managing log levels, etc.
}

// LogMessageRequest/Response would be the same as defined in CoreFrameworkAPI

```

**Data Storage:** Log messages are stored persistently. The specific storage mechanism (e.g., database, file system, dedicated logging platform) is an implementation detail, but it should support structured logging and efficient querying.

**Relationship to other Components:**
*   Receives log messages from components and applications (e.g., Sandboxes via the `Core Framework API`, other core services).
*   Provides a centralized point for all system logs.
*   May interact with monitoring or alerting systems (conceptual).
*   May interact with a database or file system for persistent storage.
