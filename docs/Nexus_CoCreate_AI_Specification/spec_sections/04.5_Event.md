### 4.5 Event

**Purpose:** Defines the standardized structure for events published within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. Events are used for asynchronous communication between components and applications, enabling them to react to changes in system state or activity without direct coupling.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "eventType": "string", // The type of event (e.g., "tool_executed", "state_changed", "log_message", "sandbox_allocated")
  "sourceAppId": "string", // The unique identifier of the application or component that published the event
  "traceId": "string", // The trace ID for the overall operation or task thread this event belongs to
  "payloadJson": "string", // The data specific to the event, as a JSON string
  "context": { // Contextual information related to the event
    "userId": "string",
    "taskId": "string",
    "projectId": "string",
    "requestId": "string"
    // ... other relevant context ...
  },
  "timestamp": "string" // ISO 8601 timestamp of when the event occurred
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `eventType`: A string identifying the type of event that occurred (e.g., "tool_executed", "state_changed", "log_message", "sandbox_allocated", "application_registered"). This allows subscribers to filter for events they are interested in.
*   `sourceAppId`: The unique identifier of the application or core system component that published the event.
*   `traceId`: The trace ID associated with the overall operation or task thread during which this event occurred. Useful for correlating events within a single workflow.
*   `payloadJson`: A JSON string containing the data specific to the event. The structure of this JSON object varies depending on the `eventType`. For example, a "tool_executed" event might have a payload containing the `ToolCall` and `ToolResult` data.
*   `context`: A JSON object containing contextual information relevant to the event, such as the user ID, task ID, project ID, and request ID.
*   `timestamp`: An ISO 8601 formatted string indicating the exact time when the event was published.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Published by various components and applications (e.g., Sandboxes via the `Core Framework API`, `ToolManager`, `StateManagerInterface`, `ApplicationRegistry`, `SandboxManager`).
*   Processed and distributed by the `EventBus` to interested subscribers.
*   Received by components and applications that have subscribed to specific event types (e.g., AI logic within a Sandbox, monitoring services, the User Interface).
*   Included in the `events` array within the `Response Payload` to provide a record of events that occurred during a request's execution.
