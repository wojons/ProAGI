### 4.4 Tool Result

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing the outcome of a tool execution within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This structure is used to communicate the result back to the component that initiated the tool call (e.g., application logic or AI in a Sandbox) and is also included in the `Response Payload` for transparency.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "toolCallId": "string", // The unique ID of the tool call this is a result for
  "status": "string", // The final status of the tool execution ("completed" or "error")
  "resultJson": "string", // The output or result data from the tool, as a JSON string (present when status is "completed")
  "error": { // Details about an error if status is "error"
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string",
    "details": { // Optional: additional structured error details
      // ... error-specific data ...
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `toolCallId`: Matches the `toolCallId` from the corresponding `Tool Call`, allowing correlation between the request and its outcome.
*   `status`: Indicates the final status of the tool execution. This will be either "completed" (successful execution) or "error" (execution failed).
*   `resultJson`: A JSON string containing the output or result data returned by the tool. The structure of this JSON object conforms to the output schema defined for the specific tool. This field is present only when the `status` is "completed".
*   `error`: A JSON object providing details if the tool execution resulted in an error. Includes a `code`, `message`, and optional `details`. This field is present only when the `status` is "error".

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `ToolManager` (or the component responsible for executing the tool, like an MCP server via the `McpHub`).
*   Returned to the `Core Framework API` in response to an `ExecuteToolRequest`.
*   Forwarded by the `Core Framework API` back to the originating Sandbox.
*   Included in the `toolCalls` array within the `Response Payload` to provide a record of tool execution outcomes.
*   Processed by application logic or AI within the Sandbox to continue the task based on the tool's result.
