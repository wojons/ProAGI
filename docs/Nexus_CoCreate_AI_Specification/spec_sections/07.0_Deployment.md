# 7.0 Deployment

This section outlines the deployment considerations for the Nexus CoCreate AI platform, focusing on the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / Proof of Concept (POC) and the future vision for deployment flexibility.

## 7.1 Deployment Flexibility (POC Simplification & Future Vision)

The long-term vision for Nexus CoCreate AI encompasses robust support for both a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offering and a self-hostable open-source version.

*   **SaaS Version:** Intended as the easiest and most accessible entry point. Features tiered subscription plans and managed infrastructure.
*   **Self-Hosted Version:** Designed for users requiring maximum control, data sovereignty, and customization. Allows deployment on private infrastructure, integration with private Git providers, use of local/private AI models, and granular admin policies.

For the **MVP/POC**, the primary focus is on building a functional core system that is architecturally sound and can later be readily adapted for both these deployment models. The initial build will likely be deployed and tested locally, for instance, using Docker Compose on a developer's machine or a single server. The server environment assumed for the POC is a standard Linux distribution capable of running Docker.

## 7.2 MVP/POC Deployment Environment

The assumed environment for the MVP/POC is a single Linux server capable of running Docker. Deployment will likely involve:

*   Docker and Docker Compose installation.
*   Cloning the Nexus CoCreate AI Core Framework repository.
*   Configuration of necessary environment variables or configuration files (e.g., for initial LLM API keys, state storage paths).
*   Building Docker images for Core Framework components and base sandbox images.
*   Running containers using Docker Compose.

## 7.3 Future Deployment Considerations (V2+)

Future iterations will need to address:

*   Scalability for multi-user and high-throughput scenarios.
*   Clustered deployments across multiple servers or cloud environments (e.g., Kubernetes).
*   Integration with cloud provider services (databases, object storage, secret management).
*   Automated CI/CD pipelines for framework and application updates.
*   Enhanced monitoring and alerting for production deployments.
*   Refined self-hosted installation and administration processes.
