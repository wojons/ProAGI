# 3.18.1 Agent Definition & Prompting

## 3.18.1.1 Introduction

The AI Logic component within Nexus CoCreate AI is driven by a flexible and extensible system for defining agent behavior, knowledge, and operational rules. This system leverages external, human-readable files (inspired by the `.clinerules` and `prompts` system from previous projects) to guide the AI's reasoning, task execution, and interaction patterns. This approach allows for dynamic loading of context and instructions, enabling agents to adapt to various tasks and domains without requiring core code modifications.

This system is fundamental to:
*   **Defining Agent Capabilities:** Specifying what tasks an agent can perform and how it should approach them.
*   **Guiding Behavior:** Providing operational rules, constraints, and preferred workflows.
*   **Contextual Adaptation:** Loading relevant knowledge and instructions based on the current task and environment.
*   **Extensibility:** Allowing users to easily add new capabilities, workflows, and knowledge domains.

## 3.18.1.2 Core Concepts

*   **Agent Definition Files:** Agents' core purpose and high-level behavior are defined in files like `AgentBrief.md` (as described in Section 3.21 Agent/Application Context & Memory).
*   **Operational Rules (`.clinerules`):** These files define explicit, often mandatory, rules and workflows that govern the agent's behavior and tool usage. They are critical for ensuring consistent, predictable, and safe operation.
*   **Prompt Resources (`prompts/`):** A collection of structured prompt templates, use case definitions, workflow guides, and reference documents that the agent can dynamically load and utilize to inform its reasoning and task execution.
*   **Dynamic Loading:** The system uses an inventory to dynamically select and load relevant prompt resources based on the current task context and user input.
*   `prompt_inventory.yaml`:** A central index file that lists all dynamically loadable prompt resources, including their name, path, type, description, triggers (keywords), and weight.

For raw examples of these prompt resources and operational rules, see Section 3.18.2 Core Prompt Examples and Patterns (See [spec_sections/03.18.2_CorePromptExamplesAndPatterns.md](spec_sections/03.18.2_CorePromptExamplesAndPatterns.md)).

### 3.18.1.4.1 Prompt Inventory Structure

The `prompt_inventory.yaml` file is a list of entries, where each entry describes a prompt resource with the following fields:
*   `name`: A human-readable name for the prompt resource.
*   `path`: The path to the file containing the prompt resource content (relative to the `prompts/` directory).
*   `type`: The category of the prompt resource (e.g., `core_workflow`, `reference_document`, `agent_prompt`, `use_case_guide`, `merged_pattern`, `output_pattern`, `planning_pattern`, `reasoning_pattern`, `prompt_style_guide`, `protocol`, `tech_specific_guide`).
*   `description`: A brief explanation of the prompt resource's purpose.
*   `triggers`: A list of keywords or phrases that the AI Logic can use to identify when this prompt resource is relevant to the current task or user input.
*   `weight`: A numerical value indicating the importance or relevance of the prompt resource, used in the dynamic loading mechanism to prioritize matches.

This structured inventory allows the AI Logic to efficiently discover and utilize the most appropriate prompt resources for a given situation, enabling flexible and context-aware behavior.

### 3.18.1.4.2 Prompting Styles

The Nexus CoCreate AI platform leverages various prompting styles to guide the AI Logic and agents in interacting with LLMs and performing tasks. Understanding and applying these styles is crucial for eliciting accurate, structured, and useful responses. Key prompting styles include:

*   **Zero-Shot Prompting:** Performing a task directly without examples. Useful for simple, straightforward tasks.
*   **Few-Shot Prompting (In-Context Learning - ICL):** Providing examples to guide the LLM on desired format or task execution.
*   **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:** Encouraging step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks.
*   **Fake CoT Prompting:** Simulating a Chain-of-Thought process within specific tags (e.g., `<cot-thinking>`) for transparency, even if the model doesn't natively support CoT.
*   **Role Prompting (Persona Prompting):** Assigning a specific role to influence the LLM's tone, style, and perspective.
*   **Structured Output Prompting:** Instructing the LLM to format output in a specific structure (e.g., JSON, Markdown).
*   **Self-Correction/Reflection Prompts:** Asking the LLM to review and correct its own output.
*   **Prompt Chaining/Decomposition:** Breaking complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts.
*   **Ontology-Driven Prompting:** Using formal knowledge representations to ground understanding and guide reasoning.

The platform also utilizes XML tags (e.g., `<thinking>`, `<planning>`, `<cot-thinking>`) to explicitly delineate the AI's internal processes within its responses, promoting transparency.

Meta-prompting, the concept of designing prompts that influence how the LLM interprets other prompts, is also a key consideration and is managed through dedicated rules.

### 3.18.1.4.3 LLM Prompt Template Format (Version 1.0)

LLM Prompts are fundamental for defining application logic within Nexus CoCreate AI, especially for components using the `LLM` handler type or workflows invoking LLMs.

#### 3.1.8.1.4.3.1 Purpose & File Format (YAML)

*   **Purpose:** To provide a standardized, version-controlled format for defining LLM prompts. This facilitates dynamic generation of prompts, metadata management, and specification of desired output structures.
*   **File Format:** Prompt templates are defined using **YAML** files.
*   **Location:** Stored within the application's definition state (e.g., `prompts/summarize_interaction.yaml`).

#### 3.1.8.1.4.3.2 Structure

Each prompt template YAML file includes the core prompt text and associated metadata:

```yaml
description: string # Optional: Human-readable description of the prompt's objective.
model: string # Optional: Overrides the application's default LLM model.
parameters: object # Optional: Default parameters for the LLM API call (e.g., temperature, max_tokens).
template: |
  # Required: The core prompt template string, processed by Jinja2.
  # Example:
  # Role: You are an AI assistant.
  # Task: Analyze the following: {{ input_data }}
  # Respond in JSON.
outputFormat: string # Optional: Hint for expected LLM completion format (e.g., "json", "text").
outputSchema: object # Optional: JSON Schema definition for expected output structure.
# examples: # Optional (Future V2+): List of few-shot examples.
```

#### 3.1.8.1.4.3.3 Templating Engine (Jinja2)

The `template` field is processed using the **Jinja2 templating engine**, enabling:
*   **Variable Injection:** `{{ variableName }}`
*   **Conditionals:** `{% if condition %} ... {% endif %}`
*   **Loops:** `{% for item in item_list %} ... {% endfor %}`
*   **Filters:** `{{ data | tojson }}`, `{{ value | default('N/A') }}`

#### 3.1.8.1.4.3.4 Output Specification (`outputFormat`, `outputSchema`)

*   **`outputFormat`:** A hint (e.g., `"json"`) for the expected general format.
*   **`outputSchema`:** A formal JSON Schema to validate structured outputs (especially JSON). Validation failures can trigger error handling.

#### 3.1.8.1.4.3.5 Processing Flow Summary

1.  A workflow step or component identifies a `promptTemplate` file.
2.  The orchestrator loads the YAML file.
3.  Jinja2 context is prepared from `inputMapping`.
4.  The `template` string is rendered.
5.  Payload for `core.llm.generate` MCP tool is constructed.
6.  MCP tool is invoked.
7.  LLM completion is optionally parsed and validated against `outputFormat` and `outputSchema`.
8.  The result becomes the output of the LLM step/component.

## 3.18.1.5 Role in AI Logic and Workflows

The AI Logic component utilizes `.clinerules` and dynamically loaded prompt resources to:
*   **Interpret User Requests:** Understand the intent and context of user input by matching against prompt triggers and use case definitions.
*   **Plan Task Execution:** Leverage planning patterns and workflow definitions to break down complex tasks into actionable steps.
*   **Guide Reasoning:** Apply reasoning patterns to structure its internal thought process and decision-making.
*   **Execute Actions:** Use operational rules to select and utilize tools appropriately and safely.
*   **Generate Content:** Apply use case definitions and output patterns to generate structured and relevant responses or code.
*   **Adapt to Context:** Load relevant technical guides or project-specific rules based on the current working environment.

This system provides a powerful, transparent, and extensible mechanism for defining and controlling the behavior of AI agents within the Nexus CoCreate AI platform, enabling them to perform a wide range of software development and content creation tasks.
