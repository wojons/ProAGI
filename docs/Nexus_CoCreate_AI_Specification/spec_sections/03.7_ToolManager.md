### 3.7 ToolManager

**Purpose:** The conceptual component responsible for discovering, registering, and executing all available tools within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This includes core tools (like file operations, CLI execution) and tools provided by connected MCP servers.

**Transport Protocol:** gRPC (Internal, high-performance communication).

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Discovering and registering core tools and their capabilities.
*   Connecting to and discovering tools provided by MCP servers (via the `McpHub` - conceptual).
*   Maintaining a registry of all available tools, their schemas, and permissions.
*   Receiving tool execution requests (e.g., from the `Core Framework API`).
*   Validating tool execution requests against schemas and permissions.
*   Executing the requested tool, either directly (for core tools) or by forwarding the request to the appropriate MCP server.
*   Handling tool execution results, including success/failure status and output.
*   Enforcing resource limits or constraints on tool execution (conceptual).

**gRPC Service Definition (Conceptual):**

```protobuf
service ToolManager {
  rpc ListTools (ListToolsRequest) returns (ListToolsResponse);
  rpc GetToolDefinition (GetToolDefinitionRequest) returns (GetToolDefinitionResponse);
  rpc ExecuteTool (ExecuteToolRequest) returns (ExecuteToolResponse); // Matches CoreFrameworkAPI's ExecuteTool
  // Add methods for tool registration, monitoring, etc.
}

message ListToolsRequest {
  optional string appId = 1; // Filter by application that exposes the tool
  optional string serverName = 2; // Filter by MCP server
  // Add other filters
}

message ListToolsResponse {
  repeated ToolDefinition tools = 1;
}

message ToolDefinition {
  string name = 1;
  string description = 2;
  string serverName = 3; // Empty for core tools
  string inputSchemaJson = 4; // JSON schema for input arguments
  string outputSchemaJson = 5; // JSON schema for output
  // Add permissions, usage stats, etc.
}

message GetToolDefinitionRequest {
  string name = 1;
  optional string serverName = 2;
}

message GetToolDefinitionResponse {
  ToolDefinition tool = 1;
  bool found = 2;
}

// ExecuteToolRequest/Response would be the same as defined in CoreFrameworkAPI

```

**Relationship to other Components:**
*   Receives tool execution requests from the `Core Framework API` (which is called by Sandboxes).
*   Interacts with core system functionalities to execute core tools (e.g., file system operations, CLI execution).
*   Interacts with the `McpHub` (conceptual) to execute tools provided by MCP servers.
*   Relies on the `ApplicationRegistry` and `StateManagerInterface` for permission checks and potentially tool definitions if stored there.
*   Provides tool definitions to components that need to know what tools are available (e.g., potentially the AI logic itself or a UI component).
