# 3.23 Application Sharing and Access Control (MVP)

This section details the mechanisms for sharing Nexus CoCreate AI applications and controlling access for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

## 3.23.1 Basic Link Sharing

Users can generate a unique, persistent, and shareable link for their created apps/projects. This link is the primary way to distribute applications.

## 3.23.2 Access for New Users

If a user without an account accesses a shared app link, they are directed to a landing page explaining the platform and prompting them to sign up or log in. For the MVP, basic email/password signup is sufficient.

## 3.23.3 Access Control (Request/Grant Model for Private Apps)

When a logged-in user accesses a shared app link for which they lack permissions (and the app is not public):
*   They are presented with a message indicating no access and an option to "Request Access" from the owner.
*   The app owner receives a notification of the access request (e.g., via Nexus chat or email).
*   The owner can grant or deny access, potentially via conversational interaction with Nexus or a simple management interface.

## 3.23.4 Permission Levels (Basic Roles for Shared Apps)

For the MVP, basic permission levels are implemented:
*   **"Owner":** The original creator with full control (definition, config, sharing, deletion).
*   **"Viewer" / "Can Run":** Can view the app's interface and run/execute the app, but cannot make changes to the definition, prompts, code, or configurations. Cannot re-share unless explicitly allowed (future).

More granular, prompt-based permissions are future work.
