### 1.5 Extensibility and Customization

## 3. Project/App Lifecycle (MVP Core Functionality)

*   **Creation – User-Friendly Initiation**:
    *   A prominent, easily discoverable "+" button (or a similar intuitive UI element like "Create New Project") will be the entry point for users to initiate the creation of a new project/app. This button will be located in the "Far Left Panel" (where projects and tasks are listed).
    *   Upon clicking this button, Nexus will immediately prompt the user via the chat interface to provide:
        1.  The desired Project Name.
        2.  A brief natural language description of what the project is supposed to accomplish.
        3.  Any other extra initial details the user might want to provide.
    *   Nexus will also handle generating an icon (with options for the user to ask for different ones or provide their own) and a short project description.
    *   The UI will show a loading indicator (e.g., "spinning") while Nexus sets up the project structure, templates, and other baseline requirements.
    *   Once ready, the UI will automatically navigate to the context of the new project, allowing the user to proceed with their tasks or further instructions via chat.
    *   Users will also be presented with clear and concise options to bootstrap their project:
        *   **"Custom Project"**: For the MVP, selecting this option will start the user with a very minimal, predefined boilerplate or template. This template would contain the bare essentials for an AppDefinition (e.g., a placeholder for the project name, a single primary prompt area for defining the app's core logic, and perhaps a default LLM selection). This allows users to start from a nearly blank slate but with the necessary underlying structure.
        *   **"Project Template" (POC Simplification)**: To demonstrate the concept of reusable starting points and accelerate app creation, the MVP should offer 1 or 2 very simple, pre-existing templates. Examples could include:
            *   A "Basic Q&A Bot" template: This might include a prompt asking the user to provide a knowledge source (e.g., paste text, upload a document in future iterations) and another prompt for defining the bot's persona or answering style.
            *   A "Simple Web Page Generator" template: This might prompt the user for the page title, main content, and desired color scheme, then generate a basic HTML page.
        These templates would provide a slightly more structured starting point and showcase different application types.
    *   Nexus can then engage in a short, guided conversational dialogue to elicit key initial requirements or clarify the user's intent (e.g., "What kind of tasks will this app perform?" or "Who is the target audience for this Q&A bot?"). However, the user must always have a clear option to skip this extended dialogue (e.g., by saying "Just create the project" or clicking a "Skip for now" button) and proceed directly to the project workspace with the minimal information provided.
*   Storage (POC – Local Git Focus):
    A fundamental architectural principle is that all projects, including their AppDefinition, configuration files, prompts, generated code, and associated assets, are stored as Git repositories. This approach inherently provides robust version control, detailed history tracking, the ability to roll back changes, and a solid foundation for future features like branching, merging, and collaborative development.
    *   For the MVP/POC, the system will manage these as **local Git repositories** on the server where the Nexus CoCreate AI platform is running. The complexities of integrating with external Git providers (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) or allowing users to specify their own remote Git server URLs can be deferred to post-POC development. The StateManagerInterface component of the Core Framework will be responsible for abstracting and handling all interactions with these local Git repositories (e.g., initializing new repos, committing changes, reading files, retrieving version history).
*   **Interaction with Nexus during Design & Development**:
    *   Users will primarily provide feedback, iterate on designs, request code generation or modifications, and define application logic by conversing with Nexus through the main chat interface. This conversational interaction is central to the UHLP paradigm.
    *   While advanced feedback mechanisms (e.g., star ratings for responses, emoji reactions, detailed UI markups on canvas elements) are envisioned for a richer user experience, for the POC, clear **text-based feedback and requests** to Nexus are sufficient (e.g., "Nexus, that's not quite right, try rephrasing the introduction," or "Generate a Python function that takes X and returns Y").
    *   Nexus's general personality and interaction style (e.g., verbosity, tone, proactivity) can be influenced by a basic set of user-configurable rules. For the POC, this could be a simplified version of the Cline rules concept, perhaps allowing the user to choose from a few predefined personality profiles or set a verbosity level. However, it's critical that when Nexus is operating within the context of a specific project, the project's own defined rules, prompts, and the overall AppDefinition will take precedence in dictating Nexus's behavior and the application's operational logic, ensuring project-specific instructions are correctly followed.
*   App Definition (AppDefinition) (MVP Simplification):
    The AppDefinition serves as the core specification and "source of truth" for any app or project within the platform. It's a structured representation (likely YAML, managed in Git) of all aspects of the application. For the MVP, a minimal AppDefinition must include at least the following essential fields:
    *   A unique name (and an internal appId) for the project.
    *   The core prompt(s) that define the app's primary function or behavior. This could be a single detailed prompt for simple apps, or a reference to a very simple, predefined workflow (e.g., a sequence of 2-3 prompts).
    *   The specific LLM (Large Language Model) to be used for the app's execution (e.g., "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo," "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"). This allows apps to leverage different models based on their needs.
    *   Crucially, as part of the UHLP and self-defining system principles, the AI (Nexus itself, or an AI component invoked during app setup or modification) should define the necessary **operational scripts** (e.g., a "start" script command, potentially a "health check" command for future use) required to run the application correctly within its Docker container environment. This script path or command will be stored as part of the AppDefinition (e.g., under a runtime.scripts.start field) and will be used by the SandboxManager to launch and manage the app.
*   **App Execution – Dockerized Sandboxes**:
    *   User actions such as "Start" or "Restart" (triggered via the project toolbar or by issuing a conversational command to Nexus) will instruct the Core Framework to execute the AI-defined operational scripts associated with that specific app.
    *   These scripts are executed within the app's dedicated **Docker container** (referred to as a "sandbox"). This containerization provides isolation, environment consistency, and resource management. The SandboxManager component of the Core Framework is responsible for orchestrating these operations, including pulling the necessary Docker image (which could be a generic base image for the POC, equipped with runtimes like Python and Node.js), mounting project files, and running the specified scripts.
    *   Once started, apps (meaning their Docker containers) will remain active in the background, capable of processing requests or performing ongoing tasks, until they are explicitly stopped by the user. This allows for persistent services or agents.
*   **Stopping Apps – Clear Control & State Handling**:
    *   Users can stop their running apps at any time, either via the "Stop" button on the project toolbar or by issuing a conversational command to Nexus (e.g., "Nexus, please stop Project Alpha").
    *   The UI must provide clear and immediate feedback that the "stop" command has been initiated and then successfully completed. This could involve updating a status indicator for the app (e.g., changing from "Running" in green to "Stopping..." in yellow, then to "Stopped" in red or grey) and possibly displaying a brief notification message.
    *   For the POC, when an app is stopped, its immediate, non-persistent runtime state *within* the Docker container (e.g., in-memory variables of the running process, temporary files not explicitly saved to the Git repo) is typically discarded. A subsequent "Start" command will initiate a fresh launch of the container image based on its AppDefinition and the files in its Git repository. Any data that the application was designed to save persistently (e.g., by instructing Nexus to commit changes to files in its Git repository, or by interacting with an external database if configured) will, of course, remain available. This simplifies state management for the initial POC.
*   Version Control & Rollbacks (POC Essentials – Git Powered):
    The Git-backed nature of projects is central to providing robust versioning and rollback capabilities.
    *   Users must be able to request rollbacks of changes by conversing with Nexus. For example, they might say: "Nexus, revert the last change made to the 'main.py' file in Project Gamma," or "Nexus, show me the previous versions of this 'config.yaml' document."
    *   The canvas interface, when viewing a file that is part of the Git repository, should feature a simple dropdown menu (or a similar intuitive UI element). This menu will allow users to see a list of previous versions (commits) of that specific file, with commit messages and timestamps, pulled directly from its Git history. Selecting a version from this list should display its content, and there should be an option to "Revert to this version."
    *   The MVP should robustly support the ability to roll back a **single file** to a selected previous version. This involves Nexus (via the StateManagerInterface) checking out the old version of the file and committing it as a new change, effectively undoing subsequent modifications to that file.
    *   Full project-level rollbacks (reverting all project files and configurations to a specific past commit point) can be considered a later enhancement if it introduces significant complexity for the initial POC, but the underlying Git infrastructure supports this.
    *   A basic "track changes" or visual diff view within the canvas to compare the current version of a file with a selected previous version (or the last committed version) would be highly beneficial for users to understand changes before reverting. If a full visual diff is too complex for the POC, at least showing the content of the selected older version alongside the current one would be helpful. The core functionality is the ability to *access* historical versions and *revert to* them.
