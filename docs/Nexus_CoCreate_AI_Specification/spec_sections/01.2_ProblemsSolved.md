### 1.2 Problems Solved

**Purpose:** This section details the key challenges in software development and AI-assisted coding that the Nexus CoCreate AI system is designed to address.

Nexus CoCreate AI is designed to address several key challenges in modern software development and AI-assisted coding:

*   **Context Loss and Memory Limitations:** Overcomes the challenge of AI memory resets by storing all project context, requirements, design decisions, and progress in a persistent, version-controlled state.
*   **Manual and Repetitive Tasks:** Automates tedious coding, testing, infrastructure setup, and documentation tasks.
*   **Scalability Challenges:** Provides a structured approach to managing complexity in medium-to-large codebases through modular state representation and efficient context handling for LLMs.
*   **Inconsistent Development Processes:** Enforces structured development methodologies (like Amazon PRD, Google OKR) to ensure consistency and rigor across projects and teams.
*   **Bridging the Gap Between Requirements and Code:** Creates a direct link between high-level user requirements (captured in structured documents) and the generated code, reducing ambiguity and misalignment.
*   **Dependency Management:** Explicitly tracks dependencies between code components, databases, and APIs to prevent broken links and ensure correct build order.
*   **Onboarding and Knowledge Transfer:** Provides a comprehensive, machine-readable (and human-readable) record of the project's state and history, facilitating rapid onboarding of new team members (human or AI).
