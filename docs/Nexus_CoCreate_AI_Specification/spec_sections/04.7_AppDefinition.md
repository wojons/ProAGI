### 4.7 AppDefinition

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing an application registered within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This definition is stored persistently by the `ApplicationRegistry` and contains all necessary metadata for the system to understand, manage, and execute the application.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "appId": "string", // A unique identifier for the application (e.g., "core.framework", "user.my-app")
  "name": "string", // A human-readable name for the application
  "description": "string", // A brief description of the application's purpose
  "version": "string", // The version of the application definition (e.g., "1.0.0", Git commit hash)
  "entryPoint": "string", // Specifies how the application is executed (e.g., "sandbox://docker/imageName", "sandbox://process/command")
  "roles": [ // A list of roles defined within this application
    "string" // Role name (e.g., "admin", "user", "workflow.my-workflow")
    // ... more role names ...
  ],
  "exposedTools": [ // A list of tools exposed by this application
    {
      "name": "string", // Tool name
      "description": "string", // Tool description
      "inputSchemaJson": "string", // JSON schema for input arguments
      "outputSchemaJson": "string" // JSON schema for output
      // ... other tool metadata ...
    }
    // ... more exposed tool objects ...
  ],
  "exposedResources": [ // A list of resources exposed by this application
    {
      "uri": "string", // Resource URI (e.g., "state://appId/path/to/resource")
      "description": "string" // Resource description
      // ... other resource metadata ...
    }
    // ... more exposed resource objects ...
  ],
  "dependencies": [ // A list of dependencies on other applications or MCP servers
    {
      "targetId": "string", // appId or MCP server ID
      "type": "string", // "app" or "mcp_server"
      "requiredVersion": "string" // Version constraint (e.g., ">=1.0.0")
    }
    // ... more dependency objects ...
  ],
  "configSchemaJson": "string", // JSON schema for application-specific configuration data
  "permissionsJson": "string", // JSON defining permissions granted to/by this application
  "author": "string", // Author or maintainer of the application
  "license": "string", // License under which the application is distributed
  "createdAt": "string", // ISO 8601 timestamp of initial registration
  "updatedAt": "string" // ISO 8601 timestamp of last update
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `appId`: A unique identifier for the application. This is the primary key used by the `ApplicationRegistry`.
*   `name`: A human-readable name for the application.
*   `description`: A brief explanation of what the application does.
*   `version`: The version of this specific application definition. This could be a semantic version string or a Git commit hash if the definition is versioned in Git.
*   `entryPoint`: Specifies how the application's code is executed. This could be a reference to a Docker image, a process command, or another execution mechanism managed by the `SandboxManager`.
*   `roles`: An array of strings defining the roles or functionalities provided by this application. These roles can be used for permission checks.
*   `exposedTools`: An array defining the tools that this application makes available for other applications or the core system to use. Each tool includes its name, description, and input/output schemas.
*   `exposedResources`: An array defining the resources (e.g., data endpoints, files) that this application makes available. Each resource has a URI and description.
*   `dependencies`: An array listing other applications or MCP servers that this application depends on. Includes the target ID, type, and optional version constraints.
*   `configSchemaJson`: A JSON string containing the JSON schema for any application-specific configuration data. This schema is used to validate configuration provided to the application.
*   `permissionsJson`: A JSON string defining the permissions granted *by* this application (what others can access) and *to* this application (what it can access). This is crucial for the security model.
*   `author`, `license`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Standard metadata about the application.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Stored and retrieved by the `ApplicationRegistry`.
*   Used by the `RequestRouter` to determine how to execute a request for this application.
*   Used by the `SandboxManager` to allocate the correct execution environment.
*   Used by the `ToolManager` and other components to discover tools and resources provided by this application.
*   Used by the `StateManagerInterface` for persistent storage.
*   The `permissionsJson` is used by the `ApplicationRegistry` and `StateManagerInterface` to enforce access control.
