### 3.5 Sandbox API

**Purpose:** The internal API exposed by each running Sandbox instance. It serves as the interface for the `RequestRouter` to submit requests for execution within the isolated environment and for the Sandbox to communicate back results, tool calls, and events.

**Transport Protocol:** HTTP/1.1 (Internal API endpoint, typically `POST /execute`).

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Receiving execution requests from the `RequestRouter`.
*   Loading the specified application code and context within the sandbox.
*   Executing the requested workflow or functionality within the application.
*   Interacting with the core Nexus CoCreate AI system via the `Core Framework API` (conceptual) for state management, tool execution, etc.
*   Generating responses, including output data, error information, tool calls, and events.
*   Handling internal error conditions during execution.

**HTTP Endpoint (Conceptual):**

```
POST /execute
```
(This is the internal endpoint within the Sandbox that the `RequestRouter` calls).

**Request Payload (Conceptual - matches RequestRouter request body):**

```json
{
  "requestId": "string", // Unique ID for this request
  "traceId": "string", // Trace ID for the overall operation
  "appId": "string", // Target application ID
  "workflowId": "string", // Target workflow or functionality within the app
  "payload": { // Data specific to the request
    // ... request parameters ...
  },
  "context": { // Contextual information
    "userId": "string",
    "taskId": "string",
    "projectId": "string", // Active project ID if applicable
    "mode": "string", // "PLAN" or "ACT"
    // ... other context ...
  }
}
```

**Response Payload (Conceptual - matches RequestRouter response body):**

```json
{
  "requestId": "string",
  "traceId": "string",
  "appId": "string",
  "workflowId": "string",
  "status": "string", // e.g., "success", "error", "pending"
  "output": { // Result of the execution
    // ... output data ...
  },
  "error": { // Error details if status is "error"
    "code": "string",
    "message": "string"
  },
  "toolCalls": [ // List of tool calls made during execution
    // ... tool call objects ...
  ],
  "events": [ // List of events generated during execution
    // ... event objects ...
  ]
}
```

**Relationship to other Components:**
*   Receives requests from the `RequestRouter`.
*   Runs within a Sandbox instance managed by the `SandboxManager`.
*   Communicates with the core Nexus CoCreate AI system via the `Core Framework API` (conceptual) to access state, execute tools, etc.
*   Executes application code loaded from the `ApplicationRegistry`.
