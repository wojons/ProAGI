### 4.13 ResourceDefinition

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing a resource available within the Nexus CoCreate AI system, typically exposed by an MCP server. This definition is used by the `McpHub` and other components to understand the nature of resources and how to access them.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "uri": "string", // The unique URI identifying the resource (e.g., "repo://owner/repo/path", "memo://insights")
  "description": "string", // A brief description of the resource
  "serverName": "string", // The name of the MCP server providing the resource
  "schemaJson": "string", // Optional: A JSON string containing the schema/structure of the resource data
  "permissions": { // Optional: Permissions required to access this resource
    // ... structure defining required permissions ...
  }
  // ... other relevant resource metadata ...
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `uri`: The unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that identifies the resource. This follows a specific scheme (e.g., "repo://", "memo://") and path to pinpoint the resource.
*   `description`: A human-readable description of the resource's content or purpose.
*   `serverName`: The name of the MCP server that provides this resource.
*   `schemaJson`: An optional JSON string containing a schema (e.g., JSON schema) that describes the structure or format of the data provided by this resource. Useful for understanding the resource's content.
*   `permissions`: An optional JSON object defining any specific permissions required for an application or user to access this resource.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `McpHub` when connecting to MCP servers and discovering their resources.
*   Stored and managed by the `McpHub`.
*   Provided by the `McpHub` in response to `ListServerResourcesRequest` or `GetServerResourceDefinitionRequest`.
*   Used by components that need to know what resources are available and how to access them (e.g., AI logic for information gathering, UI for presenting available resources).
*   Used by components responsible for accessing resources (conceptual `ResourceManager` or `Core Framework API`) for validation and routing.
