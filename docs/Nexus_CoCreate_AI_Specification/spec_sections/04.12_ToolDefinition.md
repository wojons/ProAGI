### 4.12 ToolDefinition

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing a tool available within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This definition is used by the `ToolManager` and other components to understand the capabilities of tools, their input/output requirements, and their origin (core or MCP).

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "name": "string", // The unique name of the tool
  "description": "string", // A brief description of what the tool does
  "serverName": "string", // The name of the MCP server providing the tool (empty for core tools)
  "inputSchemaJson": "string", // A JSON string containing the JSON schema for the tool's input arguments
  "outputSchemaJson": "string", // A JSON string containing the JSON schema for the tool's output/result
  "permissions": { // Optional: Permissions required to execute this tool
    // ... structure defining required permissions ...
  }
  // ... other relevant tool metadata (e.g., usage count, last used) ...
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `name`: The unique name of the tool. This is used to identify and request the tool for execution.
*   `description`: A human-readable description of the tool's functionality.
*   `serverName`: The name of the MCP server that provides this tool. This field is empty for tools that are part of the core Nexus CoCreate AI framework.
*   `inputSchemaJson`: A JSON string containing the JSON schema that defines the expected structure and types of the arguments for this tool. Used for validation.
*   `outputSchemaJson`: A JSON string containing the JSON schema that defines the expected structure and types of the output or result returned by this tool. Used for parsing and understanding results.
*   `permissions`: An optional JSON object defining any specific permissions required for an application or user to execute this tool.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by the `ToolManager` during tool discovery (for core tools) or by the `McpHub` when connecting to MCP servers.
*   Stored and managed by the `ToolManager`.
*   Provided by the `ToolManager` in response to `ListToolsRequest` or `GetToolDefinitionRequest`.
*   Used by components that need to know what tools are available and how to use them (e.g., AI logic for tool selection, UI for presenting available tools).
*   Used by the `ToolManager` for validating tool execution requests.
