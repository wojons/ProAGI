### 3.17 Core Framework API Endpoints

**Purpose:** This section provides a consolidated list and brief description of the conceptual gRPC endpoints exposed by the `Core Framework API`. These endpoints are the primary means for applications and AI logic running within Sandboxes to interact with the core Nexus CoCreate AI system.

**Transport Protocol:** gRPC (Internal, high-performance communication).

**Conceptual Endpoints:**

Here is a summary of the key gRPC endpoints available via the `Core Framework API`, grouped by the core component they interact with:

**State Management (via `StateManagerInterface`)**

*   `GetDefinitionFileContent`: Retrieve the content of a versioned definition/config file.
*   `SetDefinitionFileContent`: Create or overwrite a versioned definition/config file.
*   `ApplyDefinitionDiff`: Apply targeted, diff-based updates to a versioned definition/config file.
*   `DeleteDefinitionFile`: Delete a versioned definition/config file.
*   `ListDefinitionDirectory`: List files and directories within a versioned definition/config path.
*   `GetDefinitionFileHistory`: Retrieve the version history (commits) for a definition/config file.
*   `GetRuntimeValue`: Retrieve a volatile runtime value by key and scope.
*   `SetRuntimeValue`: Set or update a volatile runtime value by key and scope.
*   `DeleteRuntimeValue`: Delete a volatile runtime value by key and scope.
*   `ListRuntimeKeys`: List keys within a specific runtime scope.

**Tool Execution (via `ToolManager` - conceptual)**

*   `ExecuteTool`: Execute a registered tool (core or MCP) with specified arguments.

**Logging (via `LoggingService` - conceptual)**

*   `LogMessage`: Publish a structured log message.

**Permissions/Access Control (via `ApplicationRegistry` or `StateManagerInterface`)**

*   `CheckPermission`: Check if the requesting application has permission to perform a specific action on a target resource or state.

**Eventing (via `EventBus` - conceptual)**

*   `PublishEvent`: Publish an event to the EventBus.
*   `SubscribeToEvents`: Subscribe to receive a stream of events from the EventBus.

**Relationship to other Components:**
*   These endpoints are implemented by the `Core Framework API` component.
*   They are called by applications and AI logic running inside Sandboxes.
*   The `Core Framework API` delegates the actual processing of these requests to the relevant core system components (`StateManagerInterface`, `ToolManager`, `LoggingService`, `EventBus`, `ApplicationRegistry`).
