# 3.22 Intake Processing Workflow

## 3.22.1 Introduction

The Nexus CoCreate AI platform includes a structured and automated workflow for handling new files placed in a designated intake directory. This ensures that new information, such as potential agent definitions, prompt resources, or knowledge base content, is systematically processed, categorized, and archived for integration into the platform's knowledge and operational context.

## 3.22.2 Workflow Definition

This workflow is triggered upon detection of one or more new files in the `intake/` directory (relative to the current working directory of the processing component).

1.  **Trigger:** This workflow is triggered upon detection of one or more new files in the `intake/` directory.
2.  **File Selection:** Process files one at a time in alphabetical order.
3.  **File Reading:** Read the content of the file using the appropriate file system access mechanism (e.g., an MCP tool).
4.  **Content Analysis & Categorization:**
    *   Analyze the content of the file to identify its main themes, topics, and key concepts.
    *   Compare the identified concepts against the platform's core knowledge concepts (e.g., potentially stored or referenced in a knowledge base accessible via the State Manager or an MCP).
    *   Attempt to categorize the file's content by associating it with one or more relevant core concepts.
    *   If new, significant concepts are identified that are not present in the platform's existing knowledge, note them for potential future review and integration.
5.  **Logging:**
    *   Log the processing of the file. This log should include:
        *   Timestamp of processing.
        *   Filename and original path (`intake/<filename>`).
        *   Identified main themes/topics.
        *   Associated core concepts.
        *   Any potentially new concepts identified.
    *   This log entry should be stored in a designated log sink (e.g., via the Logging Service).
6.  **Archiving:**
    *   Move the original file from the `intake/` directory to an `intake-archive/` directory.
    *   The file MUST be moved without any modification to its content or filename.
    *   This step should be performed using a secure system command execution mechanism (e.g., a hardened MCP tool).
7.  **Confirmation:** The system should internally confirm the successful processing and archiving of the file.
8.  **Iteration:** Check the `intake/` directory for any remaining files and repeat the process from Step 2 until the `intake/` directory is empty.

## 3.22.3 Role in Nexus CoCreate AI

This workflow is a core operational process for maintaining and expanding the platform's knowledge base and available resources. It enables the dynamic ingestion of new information, which can then be leveraged by the AI Logic and agents for improved performance and broader capabilities. The structured nature of the workflow ensures reliable and consistent processing of intake data.

## 3.22.4 Dependencies

*   Accessible `intake/` and `intake-archive/` directories within the system's file access scope.
*   Access to the platform's core knowledge concepts or knowledge base.
*   Availability of file reading, content analysis, logging, and secure command execution capabilities (e.g., via MCP tools).
