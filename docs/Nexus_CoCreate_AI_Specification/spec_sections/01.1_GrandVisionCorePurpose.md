### 1.1 Grand Vision & Core Purpose

**Purpose:** This section articulates the overarching vision and fundamental goal driving the development of the Nexus CoCreate AI system.

Nexus CoCreate AI represents the culmination of an evolving vision for an **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-driven software development framework**. The core purpose of Nexus CoCreate AI is to automate and manage the entire software development lifecycle, from initial requirements gathering and design to coding, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. It aims to transform the development process by enabling AI agents to collaboratively build, update, and maintain codebases with minimal direct human intervention, acting as a self-sustaining development team.

The grand vision is to create a system where the complexity of software development is managed by intelligent agents, allowing human users (stakeholders) to focus on defining *what* needs to be built, rather than *how* to build it. This is achieved through a structured, transparent, and iterative process guided by a "living prompt" and a detailed, version-controlled project state.
