# 4.0 Data Models

This section defines the key data structures and message formats used for communication and state management throughout the Nexus CoCreate AI system. These models ensure consistency and clarity in how information is represented and exchanged between components.

## 4.0.1 Core Principles

*   **Clarity and Readability:** Data models should be easy to understand for both humans and AI agents.
*   **Extensibility:** Models should be designed to accommodate future enhancements with minimal breaking changes.
*   **Standardization:** Where possible, leverage existing standards or well-understood formats (e.g., JSON Schema for validation, Protocol Buffers for gRPC).

## 4.0.2 Key Data Models

The following subsections detail the primary data models used within Nexus CoCreate AI. For detailed structures of internal API request/response objects (often represented as Protocol Buffers), refer to the respective component specifications in Section 2.1 and Section 3.

*   [4.1 Request Payload](04.1_RequestPayload.md) (General structure for requests to the system)
*   [4.2 Response Payload](04.2_ResponsePayload.md) (General structure for responses from the system)
*   [4.3 ToolCall](04.3_ToolCall.md) (Structure for invoking tools via MCP)
*   [4.4 ToolResult](04.4_ToolResult.md) (Structure for results from tool invocations)
*   [4.5 Event](04.5_Event.md) (Structure for events published to the EventBus)
*   [4.6 LogMessage](04.6_LogMessage.md) (Structure for log entries)
*   [4.7 AppDefinition](04.7_AppDefinition.md) (Comprehensive definition of an application)
*   [4.8 Dependency](04.8_Dependency.md) (Representation of inter-component or external dependencies)
*   [4.9 FileInfo](04.9_FileInfo.md) (Metadata about a file in the state)
*   [4.10 CommitInfo](04.10_CommitInfo.md) (Metadata about a Git commit)
*   [4.11 SandboxStatus](04.11_SandboxStatus.md) (Status information for a Sandbox instance)
*   [4.12 ToolDefinition](04.12_ToolDefinition.md) (Schema for defining an MCP tool)
*   [4.13 ResourceDefinition](04.13_ResourceDefinition.md) (Schema for defining an MCP resource)
*   [4.14 ServerStatus](04.14_ServerStatus.md) (Status information for an MCP server)

## 4.0.3 Workflow YAML Definition (Version 1.0)

This defines the structure for declaratively defining multi-step application logic.

### 4.0.3.1 Purpose & File Location

*   **Purpose:** To provide a standardized, declarative, and version-controlled way to define the sequence of operations, data flow, and control logic for complex tasks.
*   **File Location:** Stored as YAML files within an application's definition state (e.g., `workflows/process_order.yaml`).

### 4.0.3.2 Top-Level Properties

```yaml
workflowId: string # Unique identifier for this workflow
description: string # Optional: Human-readable description
trigger:
  type: string # http, queue, cron, event, etc.
  config: object # Trigger-specific configuration (e.g., pathPattern, method for http)
startAt: string # ID of the first step to execute
steps:
  # Map of step definitions
  <stepId>:
    type: string # jit, llm, mcp, control
    description: string # Optional: Step description
    target: object # Action-specific target (e.g., script/function for jit, prompt for llm, tool name for mcp)
    inputMapping: object # Maps data from trigger or previous steps to this step's input
    transitions: object # Defines control flow (onSuccess, onFailureDefault, conditional transitions)
```

### 4.0.3.3 Step Definition

Each step within the `steps` map includes:
*   `type`: `jit`, `llm`, `mcp`, `control`.
*   `target`:
    *   For `jit`: `{ language, script, function }`
    *   For `llm`: `{ promptTemplate, model?, parameters? }` or `{ prompt, model?, parameters? }`
    *   For `mcp`: `{ tool }` (full tool name)
    *   For `control`: `{ subtype }` (e.g., `formatResponse`)
*   `inputMapping`: Uses dot notation (e.g., `trigger.body.field`, `steps.previousStep.output.value`) to map data. Literals (strings in single quotes, numbers, booleans) are supported.
*   `transitions`: Defines next step based on `onSuccess`, `onFailureDefault`, or a list of conditional transitions. A transition to `end: true` terminates the workflow.

### 4.0.3.4 Expression Syntax (V1)

*   **Data Access:** Dot notation for `trigger.*`, `steps.<stepId>.output.*`, `step.output.*` (current step's output in transitions), `context.*`.
*   **Literals:** Strings (`'text'`), numbers (`123`), booleans (`true`).
*   **Conditions:** Basic comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `>`, etc.) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

### 4.0.3.5 Execution Model

1.  `RequestRouter` identifies a `WORKFLOW` handler.
2.  Orchestrator sandbox loads the Workflow YAML.
3.  Execution starts at `startAt` step.
4.  For each step: resolve inputs, execute based on `type`, store output, evaluate `transitions`.
5.  Continues until `end: true` is reached.
6.  Final step's output is returned.

Refer to detailed UHLP documentation for more advanced V2+ considerations like loops, parallel execution, and subworkflows.
