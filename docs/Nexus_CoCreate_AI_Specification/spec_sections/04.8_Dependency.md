### 4.8 Dependency

**Purpose:** Defines the structure representing a dependency of one application on another application or an MCP server within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This structure is used in the `AppDefinition` to declare external requirements.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "targetId": "string", // The unique identifier of the target dependency (appId or MCP server ID)
  "type": "string", // The type of the dependency ("app" or "mcp_server")
  "requiredVersion": "string" // Optional: A version constraint for the dependency (e.g., ">=1.0.0", "~1.2", "latest")
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `targetId`: The unique identifier of the component that the application depends on. This can be the `appId` of another application registered in the `ApplicationRegistry` or the unique identifier/name of a configured MCP server.
*   `type`: Specifies whether the dependency is on another "app" within the Nexus CoCreate AI system or on an external "mcp_server".
*   `requiredVersion`: An optional string specifying a version constraint for the dependency. This allows applications to declare compatibility requirements (e.g., requiring a minimum version or a specific range). If omitted, the latest available version is typically assumed.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Included in the `dependencies` array within the `AppDefinition`.
*   Used by the `ApplicationRegistry` to understand the relationships between applications and to potentially resolve dependencies during application loading or execution.
*   May be used by the `SandboxManager` to ensure that necessary dependencies (e.g., required MCP servers) are available to a Sandbox instance.
