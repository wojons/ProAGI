# 8.0 Future Work & V2+ Considerations

While the specifications in this document define a functional V1 Nexus CoCreate AI platform, numerous areas offer potential for enhancement and more sophisticated capabilities in future iterations. This section outlines both general future work and specific features explicitly out of scope for the MVP/POC.

## 8.1 MVP/POC Exclusions

The following features are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) / Proof of Concept (POC) to ensure a focused and timely delivery:

*   **Advanced Security for API Key Storage:** Full integration with dedicated secret management systems like HashiCorp Vault. (POC uses simpler, masked storage).
*   **Public App Library/Marketplace & Monetization Features:** The community sharing hub, app discovery features beyond basic link sharing, and any payment integrations.
*   **Advanced "Hooks" System:** The sophisticated, user-defined event-driven automation for complex prompt chaining and inter-app communication. (POC relies on simpler prompt sequences or AI-driven direct execution).
*   **Full, Rich In-Canvas Editors:** Comprehensive, specialized editing capabilities for all diverse file types (e.g., a full image editor, a spreadsheet editor with formulas). (POC focuses on basic text/code viewing/editing and very simple image operations).
*   **Complex, User-Defined Multi-Step Workflows:** The visual workflow builder or the ability for users to define intricate multi-step workflows using complex YAML definitions are post-POC. (MVP will rely on very simple predefined internal workflows or single-prompt app logic).
*   **JIT Optimization:** The OptimizationOracle and the dynamic generation of JIT code for performance enhancement are advanced architectural features.
*   **Sophisticated Multi-User Collaboration Features:** Real-time co-editing of files on the canvas, complex role hierarchies beyond basic owner/viewer for sharing, and project team management.
*   **Self-Hosting Full Feature Parity & Admin Controls:** While the architecture should be conducive to self-hosting, the initial POC might focus on a single-instance deployment model. Full administrative controls for self-hosted instances (e.g., managing user token allocations, system-wide model configurations) will be refined in later stages.
*   **Advanced AI Customization & Learning:** Deep personalization of Nexus's core behaviors beyond basic rule sets, and mechanisms for Nexus to learn autonomously from user interactions or feedback in a persistent way.

## 8.2 General Future Work (V2+ Considerations)

Beyond the MVP/POC, future iterations (V2+) may consider the following enhancements:

*   **Advanced State Consistency:** Investigate more robust distributed consensus mechanisms or storage backends with stronger transactional guarantees. Explore Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).
*   **Enhanced Debugging & Observability:** Develop visual workflow execution tracing, integrated logging views, time-travel debugging, and enhanced metrics/tracing.
*   **Security Enhancements:** Evaluate stricter sandbox isolation (e.g., Firecracker microVMs), define security models for dynamic MCP servers, train specialized security LLMs, implement advanced input/output sanitization, and explore formal verification.
*   **Advanced Optimization Logic & Control:** Enhance `OptimizationOracle` with ML-based prediction, implement dynamic rollback, and allow A/B testing of optimizations.
*   **Enhanced Workflow Capabilities:** Implement advanced control flow steps (`loop`, `branch`, `merge`, `split`, `wait`, `subworkflow`), add sophisticated error handling (retries, dead-letter queues, `try/catch`), enrich the expression language, and develop explicit item linking/context management.
*   **Performance & Scalability:** Upgrade HTTP interfaces (HTTP/2, HTTP/3), evolve components for multi-host clustered deployments, develop cold start mitigation strategies, and implement more dynamic resource management.
*   **Advanced Caching Strategies:** Design and implement multi-layer caching (prompts, completions, JIT results, outputs), utilize appropriate storage, and develop robust cache invalidation strategies.
*   **JIT Execution & Reloading Refinements:** Implement "Server Mode" for JIT execution and robust hot reloading if needed.
*   **Framework & MCP API Enhancements:** Implement granular state reads, move towards dynamic MCP service discovery, and formally define Core Framework to Sandbox API.
*   **Tooling & User Experience:** Implement LLM-driven generation of Grafana dashboards, enhance Admin Panel features, and develop a more comprehensive testing framework.
