# 3.8 McpHub (Model Context Protocol Hub)

## 3.8.1 Introduction to MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a crucial standardization layer within the Nexus CoCreate AI platform. It defines how Sandboxed Components (LLM runners, JIT code, workflow orchestrators) interact with the capabilities provided by the Core Framework, external tools, data sources, and other services in a consistent and secure manner.

## 3.8.2 Role & Purpose of MCP

MCP serves as a **unified interface or API standard** enabling sandboxed logic to request actions or information from its surrounding environment. Instead of allowing sandboxes to make arbitrary network calls or directly access host resources, they interact primarily through well-defined MCP "tool calls".

The key purposes of MCP are:
*   **Abstraction:** Hides the implementation details of how a capability is provided.
*   **Standardization:** Provides a consistent way for LLMs and JIT code to request common functionalities.
*   **Security & Control:** Creates a controlled gateway for sandbox interactions, allowing enforcement of permissions, request validation, rate limiting, and secure operations.
*   **Extensibility:** Allows new tools and integrations to be added systematically as distinct MCP servers or toolsets.

Sandboxes are typically provided with a single `mcp_endpoint` URL (within their execution `context`) which points to their primary MCP gateway.

## 3.8.3 Multi-Server Architecture

Nexus CoCreate AI utilizes a multi-server MCP architecture:

*   **`CoreMCPServer`:** Provides foundational tools linked to Core Framework capabilities (state access, config, logging, LLM invocation, secure command execution). Acts as a central router for tool calls to other MCP servers. Typically runs as a separate container.
*   **`AppSpecificMCPServer`:** Each deployed application has its own dedicated instance. Sandboxes for that application primarily communicate with this server. It implements custom tools for the application and routes requests for core or community tools.
*   **`CommunityMCPServer`:** Pluggable, often pre-built servers providing standardized tools for common external services (e.g., AWS, Google Drive, Stripe, databases).

## 3.8.4 Scoping

*   **Core:** `CoreMCPServer` functionality is shared, but authorization ensures applications only access their own state/config.
*   **App-Specific/Community:** Tools from these servers are scoped per application. The routing layer ensures requests from App "A" are directed to instances configured for App "A".

## 3.8.5 `CoreMCPServer` Specification Summary

*   **Purpose:** Implements core framework tools and routes other requests.
*   **Hosting:** Typically a separate container.
*   **Transport:** HTTP/1.1 (V1 target).
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Identifies calling `appId` and verifies permissions.
*   **Routing Logic:** Handles `core.*` tools locally. Forwards `community.*` and `app.*` prefixes to configured downstream MCP servers.
*   **V1 Core Toolset:**
    *   `core.framework.getConfigValue`: Reads app configuration.
    *   `core.framework.logFrameworkMessage`: Logs messages centrally.
    *   `core.state.*`: Wrappers for `StateManagerInterface` methods.
    *   `core.llm.generate`: Standardized LLM invocation.
    *   `core.linux.executeCommand`: Securely executes commands via whitelists and hardened wrappers.
    *   `core.filesystem.*` (Optional V1): Scoped file access.

## 3.8.6 Non-Core Routing Example

1.  Sandbox for App "Blog" calls `community.aws.s3.putObject`.
2.  The MCP gateway (e.g., `CoreMCPServer`) identifies the `community.aws.s3` prefix and the calling app "Blog".
3.  It routes the request to the AWS S3 Community MCP Server instance configured for "Blog".
4.  The Community MCP server performs the S3 operation using "Blog"'s credentials.
5.  The result is relayed back to the Sandbox.

## 3.8.7 Modular Design

MCP servers can share a common core codebase for protocol handling. Specific tool functionalities are implemented as pluggable modules.
