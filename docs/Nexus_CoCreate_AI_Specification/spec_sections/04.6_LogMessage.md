### 4.6 Log Message

**Purpose:** Defines the standardized structure for structured log messages generated by components and applications within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. This structure ensures that log data is consistently formatted for collection, storage, and analysis by the `LoggingService`.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "level": "string", // The severity level of the log message (e.g., "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "critical")
  "message": "string", // The human-readable log message text
  "appId": "string", // The unique identifier of the application or component that generated the log
  "taskId": "string", // The ID of the task thread this log belongs to
  "requestId": "string", // The ID of the specific request instance this log belongs to
  "traceId": "string", // The trace ID for the overall operation
  "timestamp": "string", // ISO 8601 timestamp of when the log was generated
  "context": { // Optional: additional structured context fields
    // ... key-value pairs for context (e.g., "userId", "projectId", "fileName", "lineNumber") ...
  }
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `level`: A string indicating the severity level of the log message (e.g., "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "critical"). Used for filtering and prioritization.
*   `message`: The main text of the log message, providing a human-readable description of the event or status.
*   `appId`: The unique identifier of the application or core system component that generated this log message.
*   `taskId`: The ID of the task thread to which this log message is related. Useful for correlating logs across multiple requests within a single task.
*   `requestId`: The ID of the specific request instance that generated this log message. Useful for debugging individual request flows.
*   `traceId`: The trace ID for the overall operation, linking this log to the broader context.
*   `timestamp`: An ISO 8601 formatted string indicating the exact time when the log message was generated.
*   `context`: An optional JSON object containing additional structured key-value pairs that provide more context about the log message (e.g., user ID, project ID, specific file or line number, relevant variable values).

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Generated by components and applications (e.g., Sandboxes via the `Core Framework API`, other core services).
*   Sent to the `LoggingService` for collection and storage.
*   Used by monitoring, debugging, and auditing tools.
