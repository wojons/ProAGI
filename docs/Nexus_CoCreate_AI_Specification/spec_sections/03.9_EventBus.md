### 3.9 EventBus

**Purpose:** The conceptual component responsible for handling asynchronous communication and event distribution within the Nexus CoCreate AI system. It allows different components and applications to publish and subscribe to events without direct coupling.

**Transport Protocol:** gRPC (Internal, high-performance communication).

**Key Responsibilities:**
*   Receiving events published by various components (e.g., Sandboxes, Core Framework services, MCP servers).
*   Routing events to interested subscribers based on event type, source, or other criteria.
*   Providing a mechanism for components to subscribe to specific types of events.
*   Ensuring reliable event delivery (conceptual - details like guaranteed delivery or at-least-once delivery would be implementation details).
*   Handling event filtering and transformation (conceptual).
*   Potentially storing a history of recent events for replay or auditing (conceptual).

**gRPC Service Definition (Conceptual):**

```protobuf
service EventBus {
  rpc PublishEvent (PublishEventRequest) returns (PublishEventResponse);
  rpc SubscribeToEvents (SubscribeToEventsRequest) returns (stream SubscribeToEventsResponse); // Server-side streaming
  // Add methods for listing event types, managing subscriptions, etc.
}

message PublishEventRequest {
  string eventType = 1; // Type of event (e.g., "tool_executed", "state_changed", "log_message")
  string sourceAppId = 2; // Application or component that published the event
  string traceId = 3; // Trace ID for the overall operation
  string payloadJson = 4; // Event data as a JSON string
  map<string, string> context = 5; // Contextual information related to the event
}

message PublishEventResponse {
  bool success = 1;
  string message = 2;
}

message SubscribeToEventsRequest {
  string subscriberAppId = 1; // Application or component subscribing
  repeated string eventTypes = 2; // List of event types to subscribe to
  // Add filters based on source, context, etc.
}

message SubscribeToEventsResponse {
  string eventType = 1;
  string sourceAppId = 2;
  string traceId = 3;
  string payloadJson = 4;
  map<string, string> context = 5;
  string timestamp = 6;
}
```

**Relationship to other Components:**
*   Receives events from various components (e.g., Sandboxes via the `Core Framework API`, `ToolManager`, `StateManagerInterface`).
*   Delivers events to components that have subscribed (e.g., the AI logic within a Sandbox, monitoring services, UI components).
*   Enables loose coupling between components by facilitating asynchronous communication.
