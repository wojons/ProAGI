### 1.3 Target Users & Use Cases

The paramount goal for the user experience (UX) is to be deeply intuitive, primarily chat-centric, and highly capable of abstracting underlying technical complexities. Users, regardless of their technical background, should feel as though they are collaborating with an intelligent, helpful partner (Nexus) rather than programming a complex machine.
*   **Chat-centricity**: This means the chat window is not just an add-on but the primary medium for command, control, creation, and learning. It should support persistent context within a project, allowing users to pick up conversations where they left off. Thread management within a project's chat might be a future enhancement, but for POC, a single, continuous project chat log is sufficient.
*   **Abstraction of Complexity**: For example, if an app needs a specific Python library, a non-technical user might just say, "Nexus, I need my app to be able to read Excel files." Nexus should understand this, identify the appropriate library (e.g., pandas or openpyxl), and handle its inclusion in the app's environment (e.g., by updating a requirements.txt and ensuring the Docker image has it) without the user needing to know about package management. Similarly, if a user wants to connect to a common API, Nexus could guide them through the authentication and MCP tool setup conversationally.
*   **Adaptive Interface**: The interface should subtly adapt to the user's level of expertise. For novices, it might offer more guided workflows, simpler language, and hide advanced configuration options by default. For power users, it could expose more detailed settings, allow direct manipulation of configuration files (e.g., AppDefinition YAML), and provide access to advanced debugging or performance metrics. This could be achieved through user-selectable modes (e.g., "Beginner Mode," "Advanced Mode") or by Nexus learning user preferences over time.
