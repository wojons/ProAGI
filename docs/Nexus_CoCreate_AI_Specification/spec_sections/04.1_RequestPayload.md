### 4.1 Request Payload

**Purpose:** Defines the standardized structure for all incoming requests to the Nexus CoCreate AI system, whether originating from an external client (like the VSCode extension) or forwarded internally to a Sandbox. This structure ensures that all necessary information for routing and execution is consistently provided.

**Structure (Conceptual):**

```json
{
  "requestId": "string", // Unique ID for this specific request instance
  "traceId": "string", // Unique ID for the overall operation or task thread
  "appId": "string", // The unique identifier of the target application or core functionality
  "workflowId": "string", // The specific workflow, function, or entry point within the target application to execute
  "payload": { // Data specific to the request, varies based on workflowId
    // ... request parameters defined by the target workflow's input schema ...
  },
  "context": { // Contextual information about the request and user environment
    "userId": "string", // Identifier for the user initiating the request
    "taskId": "string", // Identifier for the ongoing task this request belongs to
    "projectId": "string", // Identifier for the active user project, if applicable
    "mode": "string", // The current operational mode ("PLAN" or "ACT")
    "timestamp": "string", // ISO 8601 timestamp of when the request was initiated
    "environment": { // Details about the user's environment
      "os": "string", // Operating System
      "shell": "string", // Default Shell
      "cwd": "string" // Current Working Directory
      // ... other environment details ...
    },
    "toolAvailability": { // Information about available tools and MCP servers
      // ... structure defining available tools and servers ...
    },
    "memoryBankContext": { // Relevant context loaded from the Memory Bank
      // ... structure defining loaded memory bank data ...
    },
    "userPreferences": { // Relevant user preferences
      // ... structure defining user preferences ...
    }
    // ... other contextual information ...
  }
}
```

**Key Fields:**

*   `requestId`: A unique identifier generated for each specific request instance. Used for tracking and correlating requests and responses.
*   `traceId`: A unique identifier that links together all requests and events related to a single overall operation or task thread. Useful for distributed tracing and debugging.
*   `appId`: Specifies which application or core system component should handle this request. This could be a core service ID or a user-defined application ID.
*   `workflowId`: Specifies the particular function, workflow, or entry point within the `appId` that should be executed.
*   `payload`: A flexible JSON object containing the specific input data or parameters required by the `workflowId`. Its structure is defined by the input schema of the target workflow.
*   `context`: A JSON object containing contextual information relevant to the request, such as user identity, task affiliation, project context, operational mode, environment details, and loaded knowledge/preferences. This context is crucial for the AI and application logic to operate effectively.

**Relationship to other Components:**

*   Received by the `RequestRouter` from external clients.
*   Forwarded by the `RequestRouter` to the `Sandbox API` for execution within a Sandbox.
*   Processed by the application and AI logic within the Sandbox.
*   Used by core components (like `ApplicationRegistry`, `SandboxManager`) for routing and context.
