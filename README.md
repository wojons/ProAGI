# UHLP Framework

## Project Goal
The UHLP (Ultra High Level Programming) project aims to design and build a framework and runtime environment where applications are defined using high-level, human-readable descriptions, and where a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as the core dynamic runtime logic engine.

## Core Concepts Summary
- LLM as Runtime
- Ultra High-Level Abstraction
- Declarative Definition
- State-Driven Behavior
- Adaptive Runtime (JIT)
- Sandboxed Execution
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
