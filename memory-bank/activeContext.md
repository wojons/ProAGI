# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Completing web research for the Nexus CoCreate AI POC technology stack and outlining the initial build design.

## Recent Changes
- **Nexus CoCreate AI Specification (v1) Finalized:**
    - Comprehensive documentation covering the platform's vision, architecture, core components, data models, workflows, security, deployment, and future work has been created and linked in `docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/v1.md`.
    - This includes detailed sections on Agent/Application Context & Memory (Section 03.21) and Agent Definition & Prompting (Section 03.18.1), incorporating concepts from previous projects.
    - Raw prompt examples and patterns from intake files have been included in a dedicated section (Section 03.18.2).
    - MVP/POC design details and exclusions have been integrated.
- **Intake Processing:** Documentation from previous related projects (`project_docs_intake/`) has been processed and archived.
- **Memory Bank Updates (Initial):** Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `web-research.md`) were initially updated to reflect the refined project vision and the shift towards the Nexus CoCreate AI platform.
- **Comprehensive Documentation Review:** Performed a detailed review of all Nexus CoCreate AI specification documents, intake files, and relevant archived documents to ensure consistency and completeness. Identified a minor duplication in the Core Framework API section.
- **Resolved Specification Duplication:** The duplicate file `docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/spec_sections/03.19_CoreFrameworkAPI.md` has been removed.
- **Web Research for POC Tech Stack:** Completed targeted web research for open-source Python libraries and tools for key components of the Nexus CoCreate AI POC.
- **POC Build Design Outlined:** A proposed technology stack and high-level build design for the POC have been outlined based on the research and existing specifications.

## Next Steps
1. Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect the current status and readiness for development.
2. Present the research findings, proposed tech stack, build design, and suggested development sequence to the user.
3. Begin implementing core backend components (API server, agent execution engine) as per the outlined development sequence.
4. Set up basic database structure.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The memory bank is crucial and must be kept meticulously updated.
- All work is being tracked via GitHub issues in the `wojons/ProAGI` repository.
- The Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is now the primary source of truth for the platform's design.
- The proposed POC technology stack and build design provide a concrete plan for initiating development.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- All project documentation resides within `memory-bank/` and `docs/`.
- Markdown format for documentation.
- Mermaid diagrams for visualizing architecture and flows.
- Consistent use of "Nexus CoCreate AI" as the project name.
- Prioritizing open-source libraries with permissive licenses.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification successfully integrates key concepts from previous projects (ClineAGI, UHLP) into a cohesive design for the new platform.
- The structured approach to documentation has been effective in capturing the design details.
- The comprehensive review process helped identify a minor inconsistency that needed to be resolved.
- The user's vision for a user-friendly, self-hostable/cloud-hostable platform with flexible API key management is well-defined in the specification.
- Targeted web research has identified suitable open-source libraries and clarified the approach for implementing key POC components.
- Outlining the build design and development sequence provides a clear path forward for the development phase.
