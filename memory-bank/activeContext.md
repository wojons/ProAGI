# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Developing the *full* Frontend Web UI (Admin Panel/User UI) to interact with the backend API (beyond basic structure) for the Nexus CoCreate AI Proof of Concept (POC).

## Recent Changes
- **Initial Backend Core Structure Implemented:** Placeholder classes for all core backend components (`MetricCollector`, `StateManager`, `ApplicationRegistry`, `SandboxManager`, `RequestRouter`, `SandboxAPI`, `CoreFrameworkAPI`, `ToolManager`, `McpHub`, `EventBus`, `LoggingService`, `OptimizationOracle`) have been created in `backend/src/core/`.
- **Fleshed out initial implementations of all core backend components:** Placeholder classes have been updated with docstrings, basic logging, and refined TODOs.
- **Basic FastAPI API Structure Defined:** `backend/src/api/main.py` has been updated with routers and endpoints for key functionalities (Applications, Requests, Tools, Status) and a simple dependency injection setup.
- **gRPC Service Definitions Created:** Initial `.proto` files for `StateManager`, `ApplicationRegistry`, and `CoreFrameworkAPI` have been defined in `core/proto/`.
- **Generated Python gRPC Stubs:** Python gRPC stubs have been successfully generated from the `.proto` files in `core/proto/`.
- **Main Entry Point Configured:** `backend/src/main.py` has been updated to instantiate core components and run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`.
- **Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) Finalized:** Comprehensive documentation covering the platform's vision, architecture, core components, data models, workflows, security, deployment, and future work has been created and linked in `docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/v1.md`.
- **Intake Processing Completed:** Documentation from previous related projects (`project_docs_intake/`) has been processed and archived.
- **Memory Bank Updates (Initial & Progress):** Core memory bank files were initially updated to reflect the refined project vision. `progress.md` has been updated to reflect the start of development and the initial backend structure.
- **Comprehensive Documentation Review Completed:** Performed a detailed review of all Nexus CoCreate AI specification documents, intake files, and relevant archived documents.
- **Resolved Specification Duplication:** The duplicate file `docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/spec_sections/03.19_CoreFrameworkAPI.md` has been removed.
- **Web Research for POC Tech Stack Completed:** Targeted web research for open-source Python libraries and tools for key components of the Nexus CoCreate AI POC is complete.
- **POC Build Design Outlined:** A proposed technology stack and high-level build design for the POC have been outlined.
- **Created `docker-compose.yml` for Redis and PostgreSQL setup.**
- **Implemented basic database integration (PostgreSQL, SQLModel) and API key validation logic.**
- **Created basic structure and Dockerfile for the internal Sandbox API endpoint (`/execute`).**
- **Implemented basic placeholder logic for JIT Compilation within the Optimization Oracle.**
- **Created basic frontend file structure and configured backend to serve static files.**
- **Set up basic testing environment with pytest and created a placeholder test file.**
- **Set up basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.**
- **Updated README.md and created CHANGELOG.md.**
- **Defined SandboxExecuteRequest and SandboxExecuteResponse data models.**
- **Implemented basic logic for handling different component types in the Sandbox API `/execute` endpoint.**
- **Defined User data model and database model.**
- **Implemented basic user authentication and management endpoints in the backend API.**
- **Refined ApplicationRegistry to manage updated AppDefinition structure and interact with StateManager.**
- **Refined RequestRouter to retrieve AppDefinition and ComponentDefinition, and prepare SandboxExecuteRequest.**
- **Exposed Prometheus metrics endpoint for basic monitoring.**
- **Refined Docker Compose with health checks for services.**
- **Created basic structure for Admin Panel in `index.html`.**
- **Confirmed no .proto file changes, gRPC stubs are up-to-date.**
- **Added `pytest-mock` dependency and created initial test structure for `ApplicationRegistry`.**
- **Refined GitHub Actions CI workflow to include linting and testing steps.**
- **Created basic Sandbox API service with placeholder /execute endpoint, Dockerfile, and pyproject.toml.**

## Next Steps
1. **Develop comprehensive tests for all components (beyond initial ApplicationRegistry structure).**
2. **Implement the *full* internal Sandbox API endpoint (`/execute`) logic (beyond the basic structure).**

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The memory bank is crucial and must be kept meticulously updated.
- All work is being tracked via GitHub issues in the `wojons/ProAGI` repository.
- The Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is the primary source of truth for the platform's design.
- The proposed POC technology stack and build design provide a concrete plan for initiating development.
- Initial backend core structure is in place, ready for detailed implementation.
- Basic infrastructure (Redis and PostgreSQL via Docker Compose) is now set up.
- Basic database integration and API key validation logic have been implemented.
- Basic structure and Dockerfile for the internal Sandbox API endpoint (`/execute`) are now created (including placeholder FastAPI app), and basic logic for handling different component types is implemented.
- Basic placeholder logic for JIT Compilation within the Optimization Oracle is implemented.
- Basic frontend file structure (including Admin Panel structure) is created and configured to be served by the backend.
- Basic testing suite is set up with a placeholder test file and initial tests for ApplicationRegistry.
- Basic CI/CD pipeline is set up and refined with linting/testing steps.
- Basic user and developer documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md) has been added.
- Basic user authentication and management endpoints are implemented.
- Agent/App Blueprint definition and management logic is implemented via ApplicationRegistry and StateManager.
- Initial Agent instance execution workflow is implemented in RequestRouter.
- Basic monitoring and logging visibility is implemented (Prometheus metrics endpoint).
- Initial self-hosting deployment configurations (Docker Compose health checks) are developed.
- Confirmed gRPC stubs are up-to-date as no .proto files were changed.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- The Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification successfully integrates key concepts from previous projects (ClineAGI, UHLP) into a cohesive design for the new platform.
- The structured approach to documentation has been effective in capturing the design details.
- Targeted web research has identified suitable open-source libraries and clarified the approach for implementing key POC components.
- Outlining the build design and development sequence provides a clear path forward for the development phase.
- The initial implementation of the core backend structure provides a solid foundation for further development.
