# Progress

## What Works
- **Project Setup:**
    - Foundational `memory-bank` directory created and core documentation files initialized.
    - Git repository (`wojons/ProAGI`) is set up and accessible.
    - Basic project directories (`src`, `tests`, `config`) exist.
    - Poetry is installed and the project initialized.
- **GitHub Issue Tracking:**
    - Issue #1 created for "Phase 1: Project Vision Refinement, Documentation Update, and Initial Web Research for Nexus CoCreate AI Platform" ([https://github.com/wojons/ProAGI/issues/1](https://github.com/wojons/ProAGI/issues/1)).
- **Documentation (Memory Bank):**
    - Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `web-research.md`) are updated to reflect the refined project vision and the shift towards the Nexus CoCreate AI platform.
    - `memory-bank/web-research.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` have been updated with findings from targeted web research for the POC technology stack.
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` has been updated to reflect the completion of the research and planning phase and the start of development.
- **Documentation (Specification):**
    - **Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is complete.** Initial structure and core content for all planned sections and sub-sections have been created and linked in the main document (`docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/v1.md`).
    - Comprehensive review of the specification and intake documents has been completed, confirming consistency and completeness.
    - The duplicate Core Framework API specification file (`docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/spec_sections/03.19_CoreFrameworkAPI.md`) has been removed.
- **Intake Processing:**
    - Documentation from previous related projects (`project_docs_intake/`) has been processed and archived.
    - `.gitignore` file created in `project_docs_intake/`.
- **POC Planning:**
    - Targeted web research for open-source libraries and tools for the POC technology stack is complete.
    - A proposed technology stack and high-level build design for the POC have been outlined.
    - A suggested development sequence for the POC core features has been defined.
- **Backend Core Structure (Phase 2 - Development):**
    - **Initial implementation of all core backend components fleshed out:** Placeholder classes for `MetricCollector`, `StateManager`, `ApplicationRegistry`, `SandboxManager`, `RequestRouter`, `SandboxAPI`, `CoreFrameworkAPI`, `ToolManager`, `McpHub`, `EventBus`, `LoggingService`, and `OptimizationOracle` in `backend/src/core/` have been updated with docstrings, basic logging, and refined TODOs.
    - **Basic FastAPI API structure:** `backend/src/api/main.py` updated with routers and endpoints for key functionalities (Applications, Requests, Tools, Status) and a simple dependency injection setup.
    - **gRPC Service Definitions:** `.proto` files defined for `StateManager`, `ApplicationRegistry`, and `CoreFrameworkAPI` in `core/proto/`.
    - **Main Entry Point:** `backend/src/main.py` updated to instantiate core components and run the FastAPI application using `uvicorn`.
-   **Supporting Infrastructure:**
    -   Set up and integrate Redis and PostgreSQL services (e.g., via Docker Compose).
    -   Generated Python gRPC stubs from `.proto` files.
    -   Developed initial self-hosting deployment scripts/configurations (refined Docker Compose with health checks).
    -   Confirmed gRPC stubs are up-to-date (no .proto changes).
-   **Core Platform Components (Fleshing out functionality):**
    -   Implemented basic secure API key management logic (using bcrypt and database integration).
    -   Set up and integrated a database (PostgreSQL) for application domain data and potentially framework metadata.
    -   Implemented basic structure and Dockerfile for the internal Sandbox API endpoint (`/execute`), including a placeholder FastAPI app.
    -   Implemented basic placeholder logic for JIT Compilation within the Optimization Oracle.
    -   Implemented Agent/App Blueprint definition and management logic (interacting with StateManager).
    -   Implemented initial Agent instance execution workflow (orchestrated by RequestRouter).
- **Frontend:**
    - Developed basic frontend file structure and configured backend to serve static files.
    - Developed basic structure for Admin Panel in `index.html`.
- **Testing:**
    - Developed basic testing suite (unit, integration) with pytest and created a placeholder test file.
    - Developed initial test structure for ApplicationRegistry.
- **CI/CD:**
    - Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, including linting and testing steps.
- **Documentation:**
    - Added more detailed documentation for users and developers (updated README.md, created CHANGELOG.md).
- **User Management:**
    - Implemented user authentication and basic user management endpoints.
- **Monitoring & Logging:**
    - Implemented basic monitoring and logging visibility (exposed Prometheus metrics endpoint).

## What's Left to Build (High-Level for the Platform POC)
- **Frontend:**
    - Develop the *full* Frontend Web UI (Admin Panel/User UI) to interact with the backend API (beyond basic structure).
- **Testing:**
    - Develop comprehensive tests for all components (beyond initial ApplicationRegistry structure).

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Actively in Phase 2 (Development).
- **Documentation:** Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is finalized. Memory bank files are updated to reflect the start of development and the initial backend structure. Basic user and developer documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md) has been added.
- **Development:** Initial backend core component structure, API endpoints, and main entry point are implemented with placeholder logic. gRPC service definitions are created, and gRPC stubs have been generated and confirmed up-to-date. Basic infrastructure (Redis and PostgreSQL via Docker Compose) is set up, basic database integration and API key validation logic have been implemented, basic structure and Dockerfile for the internal Sandbox API endpoint (`/execute`) are created (including placeholder FastAPI app), basic placeholder logic for JIT Compilation within the Optimization Oracle is implemented, basic frontend file structure (including Admin Panel structure) is created and configured to be served by the backend, basic testing suite is set up with a placeholder test file and initial tests for ApplicationRegistry, basic CI/CD pipeline is set up and refined with linting/testing steps, basic user authentication and management endpoints are implemented, Agent/App Blueprint definition and management logic is implemented, initial Agent instance execution workflow is implemented in RequestRouter, basic monitoring and logging visibility is implemented (Prometheus metrics endpoint), and initial self-hosting deployment configurations (Docker Compose health checks) are developed.
- **Research:** Completed targeted web research and planning for the POC technology stack and build design.
- **Planning:** Completed outlining the POC build design and initial development sequence.

## Known Issues
- Core component implementations are currently fleshed-out placeholders and require detailed implementation beyond the POC level.
- Dependency injection setup in `backend/src/api/main.py` and `backend/src/main.py` is simplified for POC and needs refinement.
- The current API key validation logic is a temporary approach for POC database integration and needs refinement for security.
- The current JIT Compilation logic is a placeholder and requires full implementation, including interaction with a Coder LLM and updating application definitions.
- The frontend is currently just a basic structure and requires significant development to implement the Admin Panel UI.
- The testing suite is currently just a basic setup and requires comprehensive tests for all components and functionalities.
- The CI/CD pipeline needs further configuration for Docker image builds, etc.
- The Sandbox API `/execute` endpoint is a placeholder and needs full implementation.

## Evolution of project decisions
- **Initial Vision (AI for Software Engineering Tasks) -> Refined Vision (Agentic AI Platform):** The project's direction has been significantly clarified by the user to focus on building a platform for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents/apps, with features like self-hosting, cloud-hosting options, and flexible API key management (BYOK model), inspired by OpenWebUI.
- **Emphasis on Memory Bank:** Remains a critical architectural choice due to my operational nature.
- **GitHub Issue Tracking:** Adopted as per `.clinerules` for all tasks.
- **MCP for Tool Integration:** Remains a key technical decision for agent capabilities.
- **Modular Architecture:** The platform is being built with distinct, interconnected components as outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1):** This document is now the primary source of truth for the platform's design and replaces the collection of intake documents as the main reference.
- **POC Technology Stack Defined:** Specific open-source libraries and tools have been identified and are being used for the initial POC implementation.
- **POC Build Design and Development Sequence:** A concrete plan for initiating development has been established and is being followed.
- **Backend Core Implementation Started:** Initial code structure for core services, API, and main entry point is now in place.
- **gRPC Definitions Created:** Initial `.proto` files for key internal services are defined.
