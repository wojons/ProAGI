# Progress

## What Works
- **Project Setup:**
    - Foundational `memory-bank` directory created and core documentation files initialized.
    - Git repository (`wojons/ProAGI`) is set up and accessible.
    - Basic project directories (`src`, `tests`, `config`) exist.
    - Poetry is installed and the project initialized.
    - Placeholder `src/main.py` exists.
- **GitHub Issue Tracking:**
    - Issue #1 created for "Phase 1: Project Vision Refinement, Documentation Update, and Initial Web Research for Nexus CoCreate AI Platform" ([https://github.com/wojons/ProAGI/issues/1](https://github.com/wojons/ProAGI/issues/1)).
- **Documentation (Memory Bank):**
    - Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `web-research.md`) are updated to reflect the refined project vision and the shift towards the Nexus CoCreate AI platform.
    - `memory-bank/web-research.md` and `memory-bank/techContext.md` have been updated with findings from targeted web research for the POC technology stack.
    - `memory-bank/activeContext.md` has been updated to reflect the completion of the research and planning phase.
- **Documentation (Specification):**
    - **Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is complete.** Initial structure and core content for all planned sections and sub-sections have been created and linked in the main document (`docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/v1.md`).
    - Comprehensive review of the specification and intake documents has been completed, confirming consistency and completeness.
    - The duplicate Core Framework API specification file (`docs/Nexus_CoCreate_AI_Specification/spec_sections/03.19_CoreFrameworkAPI.md`) has been removed.
- **Intake Processing:**
    - Documentation from previous related projects (`project_docs_intake/`) has been processed and archived.
    - `.gitignore` file created in `project_docs_intake/`.
- **POC Planning:**
    - Targeted web research for open-source libraries and tools for the POC technology stack is complete.
    - A proposed technology stack and high-level build design for the POC have been outlined.
    - A suggested development sequence for the POC core features has been defined.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level for the Platform)
- **Core Platform Components:**
    - Frontend Web UI.
    - Backend API Server.
    - Agent Execution Engine.
    - AI Service Connectors.
    - MCP Tool Integration Layer.
    - Secure API Key Management system.
    - Database schema and setup.
- **Features:**
    - User authentication and management.
    - Agent/App Blueprint definition and management.
    - Agent instance execution and monitoring.
    - Self-hosting deployment scripts/configurations (e.g., Docker Compose).
- **Supporting Infrastructure:**
    - Comprehensive testing suite.
    - CI/CD pipeline.
    - Further detailed documentation for users and developers (beyond initial structure).

## Current Status
- **Phase:** Completion of "Phase 1: Project Vision Refinement, Documentation Update, and Initial Web Research." Ready to begin Phase 2 (Development).
- **Documentation:** The Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1) is finalized and the memory bank files are updated to reflect the POC plan.
- **Development:** No platform-specific code has been written yet beyond the initial `src/main.py` placeholder.
- **Research:** Completed targeted web research for the POC technology stack.
- **Planning:** Completed outlining the POC build design and initial development sequence.

## Known Issues
- No significant known issues preventing the start of POC development based on the current plan.

## Evolution of project decisions
- **Initial Vision (AI for Software Engineering Tasks) -> Refined Vision (Agentic AI Platform):** The project's direction has been significantly clarified by the user to focus on building a platform for creating, deploying, and managing AI agents/apps, with features like self-hosting, cloud-hosting options, and flexible API key management (BYOK model), inspired by OpenWebUI.
- **Emphasis on Memory Bank:** Remains a critical architectural choice due to my operational nature.
- **GitHub Issue Tracking:** Adopted as per `.clinerules` for all tasks.
- **MCP for Tool Integration:** Remains a key technical decision for agent capabilities.
- **Modular Architecture:** The platform will be built with distinct, interconnected components as outlined in `systemPatterns.md`.
- **Nexus CoCreate AI System Specification (v1):** This document is now the primary source of truth for the platform's design and replaces the collection of intake documents as the main reference.
- **POC Technology Stack Defined:** Specific open-source libraries and tools have been identified for the initial POC implementation.
- **POC Build Design and Development Sequence:** A concrete plan for initiating development has been established.
