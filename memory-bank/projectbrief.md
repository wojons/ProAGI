# Project Brief

## Project Name
Nexus CoCreate AI

## Overview
This project aims to develop Nexus CoCreate AI, a flexible and user-friendly agentic AI platform designed to empower users to easily create, deploy, manage, and share AI-powered applications and agents. The technical foundation for Nexus CoCreate AI is based on the principles and architecture of the Ultra High Level Programming (UHLP) framework. It supports self-hosting and cloud-hosting models, offers easy setup, and allows users to leverage their own API keys for various AI services or use platform-provided defaults, giving users freedom in how they build and manage their projects.

## Goals
- To develop a self-hostable Proof of Concept (POC) for the Nexus CoCreate AI platform, leveraging the UHLP framework design.
- To enable users to easily create, deploy, manage, and share AI-powered applications/agents.
- To provide flexible hosting options (self-hosted and cloud-based) and API key management (platform-owned or user-provided).
- To offer an intuitive interface for defining, running, and monitoring AI agents/apps.
- To demonstrate the feasibility of building complex, rule-driven agentic workflows on the platform.
- To provide a foundation for future development of a more robust platform.

## Key Requirements
- Build a Proof of Concept (POC) focusing on core functionality.
- Support self-hosting for the POC.
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced security for the initial POC.
- Tool integration capabilities (via MCP).
- Natural language understanding for task interpretation (for agents built on the platform).
- A robust framework for defining and executing agentic workflows and prompt chains (drawing inspiration from `.clinerules` and prompt management systems).
- Flexible API key management (platform-owned or user-provided).
- Support for self-hosting and cloud deployment models.
- User interface for managing agents, prompts, and platform settings.
- Scalability to handle multiple users and agents (future consideration beyond POC).
- Self-correction and learning mechanisms (for agents built on the platform - future consideration beyond POC).
- Agent/Application templating system (inspired by the intake project templates).
- Per-agent/application Context & Memory for context persistence (integrated with UHLP state management).

## Initial Setup
- Git repository initialized.
- Basic README.md created.
