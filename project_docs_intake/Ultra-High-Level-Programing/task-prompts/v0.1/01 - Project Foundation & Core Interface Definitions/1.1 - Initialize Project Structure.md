## Goal: Initialize UHLP Project Directory Structure

Based on the overall UHLP architecture described in the design documents, create the main top-level directories and essential configuration files.

**Plan:**

1.  **Create Directories:** Use the `write_to_file` tool to create the following top-level directories. Initially, they can be empty, just establish the structure:
    *   `core/` (For Core Framework components)
    *   `mcp_servers/` (For MCP server implementations)
    *   `sandbox_images/` (For Dockerfiles and related assets for sandboxes)
    *   `app_state_repo_template/` (A template for new application state repositories)
    *   `docs/` (For design documents, ADRs, etc.)
    *   `tests/` (For project-wide tests)
    *   `schemas/` (For storing shared JSON Schema definitions)

2.  **Create Basic Config Files:** Use `write_to_file` to create the following files:
    *   **`.gitignore`**: Create a standard Python `.gitignore` file (include typical entries like `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.env`, `venv/`, `.pytest_cache/`, etc.). Reference security standards [11, 25] about avoiding secrets in Git.
    *   **`requirements.txt`** (or `pyproject.toml` if preferred): Create an initial, possibly empty, dependency file. We'll add dependencies in later steps. Ensure it aligns with Python standards identified in the design (e.g., Python 3.10+ from `01-python-standards.md` [4]).
    *   **`docs/adr/`**: Create this sub-directory for Architecture Decision Records, as mentioned in `10-documentation.md` [1, 13].

**Expected Outcome:** A directory structure matching the plan, with the specified initial configuration files created.
