## Goal: Create Initial Core Documentation Files

Based on the documentation standards defined in `10-documentation.md` [1, 13], create and populate the initial `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and an ADR template.

**Plan:**

1.  **Read Standards:** Briefly review the content associated with `10-documentation.md` [1, 13] regarding the required content for `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2.  **Create `README.md`:** Use `write_to_file` to create `README.md` at the project root. Populate it with the following sections (based on `10-documentation.md` [1, 13]):
    *   Project Title (UHLP Framework)
    *   Brief Overview/Goal (referencing the LLM-as-runtime concept [3, 16])
    *   Core Concepts Summary (placeholder mentioning LLM Runtime, MCP, Sandboxing, JIT Optimization, State)
    *   Links to Detailed Design Documents (placeholder pointing to `/docs`)
    *   Quick Start Guide (placeholder)
    *   Basic Usage Examples (placeholder)
    *   Contribution Guidelines (placeholder)
    *   License Information (placeholder, e.g., MIT License text)
3.  **Create `CHANGELOG.md`:** Use `write_to_file` to create `CHANGELOG.md` at the project root. Set it up according to the "Keep a Changelog" format (link provided in `10-documentation.md` [1, 13]), including an `[Unreleased]` section.
4.  **Create ADR Template:** Use `write_to_file` to create `docs/adr/template.md`. Include standard ADR sections like Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.

**Expected Outcome:** `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/adr/template.md` created with the initial structure and placeholder content as described.
