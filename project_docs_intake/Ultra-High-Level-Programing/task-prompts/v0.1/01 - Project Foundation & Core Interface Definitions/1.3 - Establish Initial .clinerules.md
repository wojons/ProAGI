## Goal: Establish Initial `.clinerules` for UHLP Project

Based on the guiding principles and standards documents provided (e.g., Python standards [4], security [11, 25], documentation [1, 13], testing [12]), create an initial `.clinerules` file to guide Cline's behavior for this project.

**Plan:**

1.  **Review Standards:** Analyze the key development standards mentioned across the design documents (focus on `01-python-standards.md` [4], `08-security.md` [11, 25], `09-testing.md` [12], `10-documentation.md` [1, 13]). Extract actionable rules for Cline.
2.  **Create `.clinerules` file:** Use `write_to_file` to create `.clinerules` at the project root.
3.  **Populate with Rules:** Add the following types of rules, referencing the design docs where applicable:
    *   **General:** "Use Python 3.10+ syntax." [4] "Prefer `async`/`await` for I/O operations as per `01-python-standards.md` section 4." [4] "Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines."
    *   **Code Structure:** "Organize tests mirroring the application code structure (`09-testing.md`)." [12] "Use structured logging (JSON format) with mandatory context fields (`timestamp`, `level`, `component_name`, `traceId`, `appId`, `requestId`) as specified in `01-python-standards.md` section 5." [4]
    *   **Error Handling:** "Use specific custom exception classes where appropriate (`01-python-standards.md`)." [4] "Do not swallow exceptions silently; log them appropriately." [4]
    *   **Testing:** "Aim for high unit test coverage (`09-testing.md`)." [12] "Use `pytest` and `pytest` fixtures (`09-testing.md`)." [12] "Include basic integration tests for interactions between core components (`09-testing.md`)." [12] "When generating JIT code, ALWAYS generate corresponding unit tests (`07-jit-optimization.md`, `09-testing.md`)." [10, 12]
    *   **Security:** "NEVER hardcode secrets or API keys (`08-security.md`)." [11, 25] "Rigorously validate and sanitize inputs, especially for file paths, database queries, command execution (`08-security.md`)." [11, 25] "When using `core.linux.executeCommand`, prioritize hardened wrappers and avoid shell interpretation (`08-security.md`)." [20, 25]
    *   **Documentation:** "Ensure docstrings explain the 'why', not just the 'what' (`10-documentation.md`)." [1, 13] "Use `# TODO:`/`# FIXME:` markers appropriately (`10-documentation.md`)." [1, 13] "Keep `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated (`10-documentation.md`)." [1, 13] "Calls modifying definition state via `StateManager` require meaningful commit messages (`04-state-management.md`)." [6, 19]
    *   **YAML:** "Write clean, well-formatted YAML with comments for non-obvious parts (`04-state-management.md`/`05-workflow-yaml.md`/`06-prompt-template-yaml.md`)." [6, 8, 9]

**Expected Outcome:** A `.clinerules` file containing actionable rules derived from the project's design and standards documents.
